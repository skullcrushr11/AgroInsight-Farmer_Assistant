BRIEF DESCRIPTION  An erect, freely tillering, tufted grass and grain crop reaching a height of 0.5-4 m. The stem is solid and leaves up to 1 m long. USES  The grain is cooked as rice, made into flour, or used to produce malt for beer. Whole grains are fed to poultry and livestock. The grain contain about 70% carbohydrate and 10% protein. Green plants provide fodder. Plant straw is used for bedding, thatching, fencing and fuel. GROWING PERIOD  Summer annual. Early millets, requires 60-95 days of growing period, medium duration types, about 80 days, and long duration types, 100-120 days. COMMON NAMES  Pearl millet, Bulrush millet, Dukn, Bajra, Babala, Spiked millet, Cat-tail millet, Cattail millet, Millet perle, Petit millet, Mijo perla, Panizo Bajra, Mil a chandella, Mil penicillaire. FURTHER INF  Scientific synonyms, P. americanum, P. spicatum, P. typhoideum, P. typhoides. Pearl millet is probably indigenous to the western Sahel zone in African. In the tropics, it can be grown at altitude between sea level and 1800 m. It can be grown between 14-32Â°N and S. Pearl millet is the staple food in parts of tropical Africa and India, which are too hot, dry and sandy for sorghum production. Photosynthesis pathway C4 III. In Africa expected yields of grain are 0.25-1.0 t/ha, normally optimum yields are from 3.0-5.0 t/ha and experimental yields of up to 8 t/ha have been reported. When seedlings are established with fresh water and fertilizer applied, multiple irrigations with seawater can give yields of 1-1.6 t/ha of grain and 3.3-6.5 t/ha of fodder. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

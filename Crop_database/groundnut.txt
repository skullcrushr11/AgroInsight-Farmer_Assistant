DESCRIPTION: An annual legume reaching a height of up to 0.6 m. The species includes both runner and bunch types. The flowers are small and yellow. After fertilization the ovaries are pushed into the ground where the fruits develops. USES: The seeds can be eaten raw or roasted or as peanut butter. They are high in vitamin B, protein, and minerals. A non-drying oil pressed from the seeds are used as cooking oil and in margarine, soap, lubricants, and pharmaceutical products. A synthetic textile fiber is obtained from the protein. Oil cakes and vines are fed to livestock. GROWING PERIOD: Annual herb or shrub, may be harvested after 90-140 days (bunching cultivars, Valencia group), or 120-150 days (runner cultivars, Virginia group). COMMON NAMES:  Groundnut, Peanut, Monkeynut, Earth nut, Arachide, Cacahuete, Mani, Erdnuss, Aardnoot, Oilenoot, Mung phali, Nila kadala, Kachang goring, Fa sang. FURTHER INF.:  Groundnut is indigenous to South America, probably upland Brazil. It can in continental environments be grown between 40°S and 45°N and it can be grown at elevations between sea level and 1500 m. Photosynthesis pathway C 3 II. Groundnut is sensitive to dry winds and to hail at an early stage. There should preferably be no rain on a crop once pods are mature. To improve yields on calcium-deficient soils, wood ash can be applied to the groundnut crop at flowering. The average yield varies from 0.6-4.0 t/ha. Seedlings can tolerate salinity better than the mature plant. Mentioned as a useful agroforestry species.

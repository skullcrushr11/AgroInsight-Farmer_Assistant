Introduction
Scientific Name: Oryza sativa L.
Significance: Major food crop of northeastern states.
Traditional Organic Cultivation: Common in hill regions (uplands and jhooms).
Fertilizer Use: Minimal, even in plains.
Potential for Organic Production: High due to existing low fertilizer usage.
Organic Rice Production
Key Practices:
Recycling crop residues
Crop rotation and inclusion of legumes
Green manuring
Off-farm waste recycling
Use of mineral rocks (e.g., rock phosphate)
Mechanical cultivation
Biological and organic pest control
Challenges:
Weed control
Soil fertility management
Pest and disease management

Land Preparation
For Transplanting
Land Preparation:
Thorough ploughing and leveling with bunding.
Puddling (3–4 times) for weed control and water retention.
Organic Inputs:
FYM: 15 t/ha OR
FYM: 7.5 t/ha + Vermicompost (VC) 2.5 t/ha + 150 kg/ha Rock Phosphate (applied 20 days before last ploughing).
Alternative manure sources: Chicken manure, deoiled meals, etc.
For Direct Seeding
Land Preparation:
Two cross ploughings (total 4 ploughings) for good tilth and weed-free land.
Application of lime @ 2 t/ha at first or second ploughing (1–2 weeks before sowing).
Liming Frequency: Every 3–4 years.
Organic Inputs:
Similar to transplanting method.

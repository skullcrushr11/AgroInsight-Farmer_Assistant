Introduction to Paddy Cultivation
Paddy, also known as ‘rice paddy’, is cultivated in southern and eastern Asia. Paddy fields must always be irrigated, and the crop is cultivated in standing water. Paddy plants are grown in impermeable subsoil and are bordered by earthen bunds to hold an average of 10–15 cm of water in a field for three-quarters of the growing season. The plants produce rice, an edible starchy cereal grain. Roughly, one-half of the world population, including almost the entire East and Southeast Asia, is solely dependent on rice as a staple food. Ninety-five per cent of the world’s rice is consumed by humans. The cultivated rice plant, Oryza sativa, is an annual grass of the Gramineae family.

Paddy cultivation probably started between the fifteenth and twentieth century B.C. in the Himalayan and submontane regions. The domestication of paddy is considered one of the most important developments in human history. Rice first finds mention in the Yajur Veda (1500–800 B.C.), followed by many Sanskrit texts. Rice is consumed by a majority of the Indian population as a staple food. Paddy is a monocot annual plant belonging to Poaceae (Gramineae) family, and the number of its chromosomes is 2n=24. The height of paddy plants usually varies from half-a-metre to two metres. Paddy cultivation is labour-intensive, and the plants need enough water for irrigation.

Sub-species of Paddy
Rice grain can be of different colours and sizes. Rice is a grain belonging to the genus Oryza. This genus has two important species — Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice). Species is not the only factor that differentiates between living beings. Variation exists among populations of the same species based on various other factors. Sub-species, race, and breed are used to describe the different types of variation. Rice species are further grouped into three sub-species — Indica, Japonica, and Javanica.

Indica
Paddy crop cultivated in India belongs to the Indica sub-species. It either does not have awns or possesses short and smooth awns. Indica is a major eco-geographical sub-species of paddy, primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions, covering major south and south-east Asian countries. The leaves of the plant are mostly light green in colour, narrow or broad. The plant is medium or tall (except the semi-dwarf gene, which has been introduced into this group of genotypes recently). Indica rice varieties have profuse tillering, and slender and flat grains.

Japonica
Named after Japan, this group of paddy plants is characterised by narrow, dark green leaves, medium height tillers, oval and round grains, and short to intermediate plant stature. The panicles may be with or without awns.

Javanica
It denotes the bulu and gundil varieties of Indonesia, mostly suitable for upland paddy cultivation. Javanica paddy plants are characterised by broad, stiff, and light green leaves, stiff straw, and long panicles with awned grains. They generally have poor tillering. The spikes of the plant may be with or without awns, with long-duration maturity.

Rice Varieties
Aerobic Rice
Aerobic rice varieties are grown in well-drained, non-puddled, and aerated soils, and have an average yield of 4–5 tonnes per hectare. Paddy plants yielding such varieties are mostly cultivated on levelled and flat lands, where rains, with or without supplementary irrigation, are sufficient to support the crop for a full season.

Hybrid Rice
Varieties produced by crossing between two different parents are known as hybrids. Hybrid varieties of rice have been found to be more robust, tillering, nutrient-responsive, higher yielding, and better than common high-yielding varieties (HYVs). Hybrids are less susceptible to diseases, drought, and other agronomic vagaries.

Basmati Rice
These are characterised by thin and longer grains and have an aroma with a distinct taste. Such rice varieties are extensively grown and consumed across the world. The rice grains have a light and fluffy texture on cooking. India produces the world’s finest basmati rice varieties.

Golden Rice
This is a Genetically Modified (GM) variety of rice that carries a gene for the biosynthesis of β-carotene, which is converted to Vitamin A on consumption. However, being a GM crop, there are several impediments to its cultivation in many Asian countries.

Boro Rice
It refers to the cultivation of rice between November and May, especially in the eastern parts of India, i.e., West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, etc. The cultivation of boro rice is practised in areas generally left fallow during winters due to excessive soil moisture conditions after harvesting of the crop. Boro crop planted after the cultivation of Kharif crop matures before the onset of the next monsoon and fetches a higher market price.

Organic Rice
Organic rice farming denotes paddy cultivation without the use of fertilisers and chemical pesticides. Such a variety totally depends on Farm Yard Manure (FYM), compost, animal wastes or by-products like cattle and poultry, green manure, mineral nutrients, and biological pests, which are important to maintain soil health and check insect–pests, diseases, and weeds.

Integrated Rice and Fish Farming
Fish rearing in paddy fields without impacting the rice quality and yield is known as ‘integrated rice and fish farming’. It helps in earning extra income, i.e., apart from the main crop (rice) yield. Rice and fish farming is widely practised in Asian countries.

Session 1: Importance of Paddy Cultivation
India is the second-largest producer of rice in the world after China and has the largest area under paddy cultivation. Therefore, rice is the principal staple food crop in India. Data on the area earmarked for paddy cultivation and production of rice indicate a considerable increase in the area dedicated to its cultivation from 1950–51 to 2016–17 (Table 1.1). Within a span of 66 years, rice production in India has increased by about five times, while the productivity (yield/ha) has increased by about four times. The country has HYVs. India has achieved this enhanced production due to the use of advanced and effective agricultural technologies.

Economic Importance of Rice in India
Rice is the staple food crop in India. It plays a significant role in the national food and livelihood security system, as well as helps earn significant foreign exchange as it is exported to other countries. In India, the contribution of rice in the total agricultural export was 20 per cent in 2014–15 and 17.7 per cent in 2015–16 (Directorate of Economics and Statistics, 2016). Rice export (basmati and non-basmati) reported by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, during 2015–16 is given in Table 1.2.

Rice straw is used as fodder, fuel, and for making thatched rooftops, mats, hats, and straw boards. It is treated with urea to make feeds for ruminants. Rice bran contains 20 per cent oil and other nutritious minerals. Rice bran oil is considered better than other vegetable oils for its low cholesterol level.

Nutritional Value of Rice
Rice is the predominant dietary source of energy. Starch is the main constituent of rice grain, providing instant energy. Because of higher starch content, it is used for preparing various food items, such as rice flour, rice flakes, canned rice, popped or puffed rice, and fermented products. The major nutrients in rice are given in Table 1.3.

Session 2: Climatic Requirements and Paddy Growing Regions
Paddy is a semi-aquatic plant. Tropical climate is most suitable for its cultivation. However, paddy crop is also grown extensively in subtropical and temperate climates. In India, paddy cultivation is done almost round the year in different regions, spanning three seasons — Kharif, Rabi, and Zaid, depending on the cultivar, climate, and availability of water.

Conditions for Paddy Cultivation
Rainfall: Paddy is generally cultivated in areas receiving a rainfall of 750–1250 cm annually.

Temperature: The optimum temperature required for paddy cultivation is 30°C in the day and 20°C at night. However, the plant can tolerate higher temperatures up to 40°C for a short period.

Day length or sunshine: Sunlight significantly influences the growth of paddy crops. Sunshine with low temperatures during the ripening stage improves grain quality, helps in the development of carbohydrates, and also results in overall better yield.

Soil: Paddy is cultivated in soils with variable characteristics but grows well in soils having a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Soils with optimum water holding and drainage capacity are suitable for paddy cultivation.

Rice Cropping Seasons
Paddy cultivation can be carried out throughout the year in the eastern and southern parts of India by taking two–three crops annually. It is mostly cultivated during the Kharif season in northern and western India like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. Here, only one crop is grown in the Kharif season as the temperatures during winters are too low for paddy cultivation. The crop duration, time of sowing, and harvesting of the crop are presented in Table 1.4.

Table 1.4: Time of Sowing and Harvesting Paddy Crop in India
Local Name	Crop Season	Sowing	Harvesting
Aus (autumn rice)	Pre–Kharif	May–June	September–October
Aman (winter rice)	Kharif	June–July	November–December
Boro (summer rice)	Zaid	November–December	March–April
Rice Growing Regions in India
Uttar Pradesh has the largest area under paddy cultivation, followed by West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, and Punjab. These States collectively account for about 92 per cent of the total area under paddy cultivation in the country (Table 1.5). A classification of the regions primarily under paddy cultivation is as follows:

Arid Western Plains

Semi-arid Lava Plateau and Central Highlands

Humid to semi-arid Western Ghats and Karnataka Plateau

Humid western Himalayan region

Sub-humid Sutlej–Ganga alluvial plains

Sub-humid to humid eastern and south-eastern uplands

Humid Bengal–Assam Basin and humid eastern Himalayan region

Rice Ecologies
Ecology refers to the relationship between different organisms and that with their physical surroundings. Paddy is cultivated in different agro-ecological zones across India. No other country in the world has such diversity in the rice ecosystem as India. There are four distinct ecosystems in India.

Irrigated Rice Ecosystem: This ecosystem is primarily found in eastern Asia and provides 75 per cent of the global rice production. In India, irrigated paddy is cultivated in bunded fields (an earthen wall around a field) and occupies a total area of about 22 million ha (49.5 per cent). This type of paddy cultivation is mainly practised in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Gujarat.

Rain-fed Upland Rice Ecosystem: This system is prevalent in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In India, the total area under rain-fed upland paddy cultivation is about six million ha (13.5 per cent). It is grown extensively in eastern and north-eastern States, often seeded in dry seedbeds on rolling or sloping land.

Rain-fed Lowland Rice Ecosystem: About 25 per cent of the global paddy cultivation is under the rain-fed lowland ecosystem. India has over 33 per cent area under this ecosystem. The major constraints in this ecosystem include poor soil health, frequent droughts, and floods, resulting in poor yield.

 Flood-prone (Deep Water) Rice Ecosystem
Flood-prone ecosystems are prevalent in South and south-east India, and the central Gangetic plains of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Flooding usually occurs during June to September, mostly preceded and followed by drought. Paddy varieties cultivated in this ecosystem are selected based on their tolerance to water submergence. However, yields in this ecosystem are generally low due to the challenging conditions.

Summary of Rice Ecosystems in India
Ecosystem	Characteristics	Regions in India
Irrigated Rice Ecosystem	Bunded fields with controlled water supply; high productivity.	Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, etc.
Rain-fed Upland Rice Ecosystem	Grown on rolling or sloping land; dependent on rainfall.	Eastern and north-eastern States.
Rain-fed Lowland Rice Ecosystem	Cultivated in areas with poor soil health, droughts, and floods; moderate yields.	Across India, especially in regions with erratic rainfall.
Flood-prone (Deep Water) Rice Ecosystem	Tolerant to water submergence; low yields due to flooding.	South and south-east India, central Gangetic plains (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar).
Conclusion
Paddy cultivation is a cornerstone of agriculture in India and many parts of Asia, providing food security and livelihoods to millions. The diversity in rice ecosystems, sub-species, and varieties highlights the adaptability of rice to different climatic and soil conditions. From the high-yielding irrigated fields of Punjab to the flood-prone regions of Bihar, rice cultivation continues to evolve with advancements in agricultural technology and sustainable practices. The economic and nutritional importance of rice makes it a vital crop for India and the world.

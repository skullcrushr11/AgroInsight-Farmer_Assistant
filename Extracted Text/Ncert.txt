Introduction
Paddy, also known as ‘rice paddy’, is cultivated in southern and eastern Asia. Paddy fields must always be irrigated and the crop be cultivated in standing water. Paddy plants are cultivated in impermeable subsoil and are bordered by earthen bunds to hold an average of 10–15 cm water in a field for three quarters of the growing season.The plants produce rice, an edible starchy cereal grain. Roughly, one–half of the world population, including almost the entire East and Southeast Asia, is solely dependent on rice as a staple food. Ninety-five per cent of the world’s rice is consumed by humans. The cultivated rice plant, Oryza sativa, is an annual grass of the Gramineae family.Paddy cultivation probably started between the fifteenth and twentieth century B.C. in the Himalayan and submontane regions. The domestication of paddy is considered as one 
of the most important developments in human 
history. Rice first finds mention in the Yajur Veda  
(1500–800 B.C.), followed by many Sanskrit 
texts. Rice is consumed by a majority of the Indian 
population as a staple food. Paddy is a monocot 
annual plant belonging to Poaceae (Gramineae)

family and the number of its chromosomes is 
2n=24. The height of paddy plants, usually, 
vary from half-a-metre to two metres. Paddy 
cultivation is labour intensive and the plants 
need enough water for irrigation.
Sub-species of Paddy
Rice grain can be of different colours 
and sizes. Rice is a grain belonging to the 
genus Oryza. This genus has two important 
species — Oryza sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza 
glaberrima (African rice). Species is not the 
only factor that differentiates between living 
beings. Variation exists among populations 
of the same species based on various other 
factors. Sub-species, race and breed are used 
to describe the different types of variation. 
Rice species are further grouped into three 
sub-species — Indica, Japonica and Javanica. 
Indica
Paddy crop cultivated in India belongs to the 
Indica sub-species. It either does not have 
awns or possesses short and smooth awns. 
Indica is a major eco-geographical sub-species 
of paddy, primarily grown in tropical and 
subtropical regions, covering major south and 
south-east Asian countries. The leaves of the 
plant are mostly light green in colour, narrow or 
broad. The plant is medium or tall (except the 
semi-dwarf gene, which has been introduced 
into this group of genotypes recently). Indica 
rice varieties have profuse tillering, and slender 
and flat grains. 
Japonica
Named after Japan, this group of paddy plant 
is characterised by narrow, dark green leaves, 
medium height tillers, oval and round grains, 
and short to intermediate plant stature. The 
panicles may be with or without awns.

Javanica
It denotes the bulu and gundil varieties of 
Indonesia mostly suitable for upland paddy 
cultivation. 
Javanica 
paddy 
plants 
are 
characterised by broad, stiff and light green 
leaves, stiff straw and long panicles with awned 
grains. They, generally, have poor tillering. The 
spikes of the plant may be with or without awns 
with long duration maturity. 
Rice Varieties
Aerobic rice
Aerobic 
rice 
varieties 
are 
grown 
in 
well-drained, non-puddled and aerated soils, 
and have an average yield of 4–5 tonne per 
hectare. Paddy plants, yielding such varieties, 
are mostly cultivated on levelled and flat lands, 
where rains, with or without supplementary 
irrigation, are sufficient to support the crop for 
a full season.
Hybrid rice
Varieties produced by crossing between two 
different parents are known as hybrids. Hybrid 
varieties of rice have been found to be more 
robust, tillering, nutrient responsive, higher 
yielding and better than common high yielding 
varieties (HYVs). Hybrids are less susceptible 
to diseases, drought and other agronomic 
vagaries. 
Basmati rice
These are characterised by thin and longer 
grains, and have an aroma with a distinct taste. 
Such rice varieties are extensively grown and 
consumed across the world. The rice grains 
have a light and fluffy texture on cooking. 
India produces the world’s finest basmati 
rice varieties.

Golden rice
This is a Genetically Modified (GM) variety of rice that 
carries a gene for biosynthesis of β-carotene, which 
is converted to Vitamin A on consumption. However, 
being a GM crop, there are several impediments for its 
cultivation in many Asian countries. 
Boro rice
It refers to the cultivation of rice between November 
and May, especially, in the eastern parts of India, 
i.e., West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, etc. The cultivation 
of boro rice is practised in areas, generally, left fallow 
during winters due to excessive soil moisture conditions 
after harvesting of the crop. Boro crop planted after the 
cultivation of Kharif crop matures before the onset of 
next monsoon and fetches higher market price.
Organic rice
Organic rice farming denotes paddy cultivation without 
the use of fertiliser and chemical pesticides. Such a 
variety totally depends on Farm Yard Manure (FYM), 
compost, animal wastes or by-products like cattle and 
poultry, green manure, mineral nutrients and biological 
pests, which are important to maintain soil health and 
check insect–pests, diseases and weeds.
Integrated Rice and Fish Farming
Fish rearing in paddy fields without impacting the rice 
quality and yield is known as ‘integrated rice and fish 
farming’. It helps in earning extra income, i.e., apart 
from the main crop (rice) yield. Rice and fish farming is 
widely practised in Asian countries.
Session 1: Importance of Paddy Cultivation 
India is the second largest producer of rice in the 
world after China and has the largest area under 
paddy cultivation. Therefore, rice is the principal 
staple food crop in India. Data on area earmarked 
for paddy cultivation and production of rice indicate

a considerable increase in the area dedicated to its 
cultivation 1950–51 to 2016–17 (Table 1.1). Within 
a span of 66 years, rice production in India has 
increased by about five times, while the productivity 
(yield/ha) has increased by about four times. The 
country has HYVs. India has achieved this enhanced 
production due to the use of advanced and effective 
agricultural technologies.

Economic importance of rice in India
Rice is the staple food crop in India. It plays a significant 
role in the national food and livelihood security system, 
as well as, helps earn significant foreign exchange as it 
is exported to other countries. In India, the contribution 
of rice in the total agricultural export was 20 per cent in 
2014–15 and 17.7 per cent in 2015–16 (Directorate of 
Economics and Statistics, 2016). Rice export (basmati 
and non-basmati) reported by the Ministry of Commerce 
and Industry, Government of India, during 2015–16 is 
given in Table 1.2.

Rice straw is used as fodder, fuel, and for making 
thatched rooftops, mats, hats and straw boards. It is 
treated with urea to make feeds for ruminants. Rice bran 
contains 20 per cent oil and other nutritious minerals. 
Rice bran oil is considered better than other vegetable 
oils for its low cholesterol level.
Nutritional value of rice
Rice is the predominant dietary source of energy. Starch 
is the main constituent of rice grain, providing instant 
energy. Because of higher starch content, it is used for 
preparing various food items, such as rice flour, rice 
flakes, canned rice, popped or puffed rice and fermented 
products. The major nutrients in rice is given in 
Table 1.3.

Session 2: Climatic Requirements and 
Paddy Growing Regions
Paddy is a semi-aquatic plant. Tropical climate is most 
suitable for its cultivation. But paddy crop is also grown 
extensively in subtropical and temperate climates. In India, 
paddy cultivation is done almost round the year in different 
regions, spanning three seasons — Kharif, Rabi and Zaid, 
depending on the cultivar, climate and availability of water. 
Conditions for paddy cultivation
Rainfall
Paddy is, generally, cultivated in areas receiving a 
rainfall of 750–1250 cm annually.
Temperature
The optimum temperature required for paddy cultivation 
is 30°C in the day and 20°C in the night. But the plant 
can tolerate higher temperatures up to 40°C for a 
short period.
Day length or sunshine
Sunlight significantly influences the growth of paddy 
crop. Sunshine with low temperatures during the 
ripening stage improves the grain quality, helps in 
the development of carbohydrates, and also results in 
overall better yield.
Soil 
Paddy is cultivated in soils with variable characteristics 
but grows well in soils having a pH of 5.5 to 6.5. Soils 
with optimum water holding and drainage capacity are 
suitable for paddy cultivation. 
Rice cropping seasons
Paddy cultivation can be carried out throughout the 
year in the eastern and southern parts of India by taking 
two–three crops annually. It is mostly cultivated during 
the Kharif season in northern and western India like 
Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab,

Haryana, 
Uttarakhand, 
Uttar 
Pradesh, 
Gujarat,

grown in the Kharif season as the temperatures during 
winters are too low for paddy cultivation. The crop 
duration, time of sowing and harvesting of the crop is 
presented in Table 1.4.

Rice ecologies
Ecology refers to the relationship between 
different organisms and that with their 
physical surroundings. Paddy is cultivated 
in different agro ecological zones across 
India. No other country in the world has such 
diversity in rice ecosystem as India. There are 
four distinct ecosystems in India. 
Irrigated rice ecosystem
This ecosystem is primarily 
found in eastern Asia and 
provides 75 per cent of 
the global rice production. 
In India, irrigated paddy is 
cultivated in bunded fields (an earthen wall 
around a field) and occupies a total area of 
about 22 million ha (49.5 per cent). This type 
of paddy cultivation is mainly practised in 
Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal 
Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, 
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka 
and Gujarat.
Rain-fed upland rice ecosystem
This system is prevalent in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America. In India, the total area under rain-fed 
upland paddy cultivation is about six million ha 
(13.5 per cent). It is grown extensively in eastern and 
north-eastern States, often seeded in dry seedbed on 
rolling or sloping land.

Rain-fed lowland rice ecosystem
About 25 per cent of the global paddy cultivation is 
under rain-fed lowland ecosystem. India has over 
33 per cent area under this ecosystem. The major 
constraints in this ecosystem include poor soil health, 
frequent droughts and floods, resulting in poor yield.
Flood-prone (deep water) rice ecosystem
Flood-prone ecosystem is prevalent in South and 
south-east India, and the central Gangetic plains of 
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Flooding, usually, occurs 
during June to September, mostly preceded and followed 
by drought. Paddy varieties to be cultivated in this 
ecosystem are selected on the basis of their tolerance to 
water submergence. Their yields are low.

China is the world's biggest producer, growing one-third of Asia's total on 29 million ha. India produces nearly a quarter on 43 million ha. Other top rice-producing countries in Asia are mentioned in Table 1.1. Average yields in these countries range from 2.6 to 6.5 t/ha. Table 1.1: Average Annual Rice Production, Area Harvested, and Yield in Most Important Countries or Regions\n\nCountry or Region\tProduction (Million Tons)\tArea Harvested (Million ha)\tYield (t/ha)\nChina\t188.5\t28.7\t6.5\nIndia\t142.5\t42.8\t3.3\nIndonesia\t58.3\t11.7\t5.0\nBangladesh\t42.5\t10.9\t3.9\nVietnam\t36.0\t7.5\t4.8\nThailand\t30.5\t9.9\t2.6\nMyanmar\t32.0\t8.9\t3.6\nPhilippines\t17.5\t4.6\t3.8\nJapan\t10.9\t1.7\t6.4\nOther Asian Countries\t35.8\t10.9\t3.3\nAsia\t594.5\t137.6\t4.3\nBrazil\t12.1\t-\t-\nWorld\t597.8\t155.0\t3.9\nAll tonnage terms in this publication are metric, unless otherwise indicated. Worldwide, around 79 million ha of rice is grown under irrigated conditions. While this is only half of the total rice area, it accounts for about 75% of the world's annual rice production. In Asia, nearly 60% of the 138 million hectares devoted to rice production annually is irrigated, where rice is often grown in monoculture with two to three crops a year depending upon water availability. Other rice ecosystems include the rainfed lowland (35% of total rice area), characterized by a lack of water control, with floods and drought being potential problems, and the upland and deepwater ecosystems (5% of total rice area), where yields are low and extremely variable. Thailand is the world's major rice trader, exporting an average of 8 million tons of rice annually (Figure 1.1). Vietnam and India export a total of 7 million tons. A positive trade balance for rice has been maintained by Asia, Australia, and the United States. Latin America, Africa, and Europe are net importers of rice. Figure 1.1: Global Rice Trade - Average of Data for 2000 to 2004 (FAO 2006)\n\nThe demand for rice is expected to grow for many years to come largely because of population growth, particularly in Asia, where the population is expected to increase by 35% by 2025 (United Nations, 1999)."

        "content": "An increase in total rice production may come from an increase in the area planted, increased yields, and increased cropping intensity. However, the scope for expansion of rice-growing areas is limited because of the loss of agricultural land to urbanization, land conversion, and industrialization. Therefore, future increases in rice supply must come from increased yields and intensified cropping, particularly in the irrigated rice ecosystem. There is substantial scope to increase current rice yields as farmers in Asia, on average, achieve only about 60% of the yield potentially achievable with existing varieties and climatic conditions. The main limitation to achieving higher yields and associated higher profitability for rice farmers per unit of arable land is often the ineffective use of inputs (particularly nutrients, seed, and pesticide) in an environmentally sustainable fashion. If the demand for food is to be met, rice production will need to become more efficient in the use of increasingly scarce natural resources. Better crop, nutrient, pest, and water management practices, along with the use of germplasm with a higher yield potential, are required for rice production to be profitable for producers and to supply sufficient affordable staple food for consumers. 1.2 History\nMany historians believe that rice was grown as far back as 5000 B.C. Archaeologists excavating in India discovered rice, which they were convinced could be dated to 4530 B.C. However, the first recorded mention originates from China in 2800 B.C. Around 500 B.C., cultivation spread to parts of India, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and eventually to Japan. Although China, India, or Thailand cannot be identified as the home of the rice plant (indeed it may have been native to all), it is relatively clear that rice was introduced to Europe and the Americas by travelers who took with them the seeds of the crops that grew in their homes and in foreign lands. In the West, parts of America and certain regions of Europe, such as Italy and Spain, are able to provide the correct climate, thereby giving rise to a thriving rice industry. The first cultivation in the U.S., along coastal regions from South Carolina to Texas, started in 1685. Some historians believe that rice traveled to America in 1694, in a British ship bound for Madagascar. 1.3 Plant Description\nThe rice plant is an annual warm-season grass (monocot plant) with round culms, flat leaves, and terminal panicles."

The rice plant can grow to 1\u20131.8 m tall, occasionally more, depending on the variety and soil fertility. The grass has long, slender leaves 50\u2013100 cm long and 2\u20132.5 cm broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30\u201350 cm long. The edible seed is a grain (caryopsis) 5\u201312 mm long and 2\u20133 mm thick. The Grain\nThe single seed is fused with the wall, which is the pericarp of the ripened ovary forming the grain. Each rice panicle (which is a determinate inflorescence on the terminal shoot), when ripened, contains on average 80-120 grains, depending on varietal characteristics, environmental conditions, and the level of crop management. The floral organs are modified shoots consisting of a panicle, on which are arranged a number of spikelets. Each spikelet bears a floret which, when fertilized, develops into a grain. Rice Grain Structure\nA kernel of rice consists of a hull and a bran coat, both of which are removed on polishing \"white\" rice. In general, each rice kernel is composed of the following layers:\n\nRice shell, hull, or husk: Encloses the bran coat, the embryo, and the endosperm. Bran Coat (layer): A very thin layer of differentiated tissues. The layer contains fiber, vitamin B, protein, and fat. The most nutritious part of rice resides in this layer. Embryo: The innermost part of a rice grain consists mainly of starch called amylase and amylopectin. The mixture of these two starches determines the cooking texture of rice. A crop producing on average 300 panicles per m\u00b2 and 100 spikelets per panicle, with an average spikelet sterility of 15% at maturity and a 1000-grain weight of 20 g will have an expected yield of 5.1 t/ha.

Ideally, soil needs to include about 50% clay content. Also, soil underlain with an impervious hardpan or clay-pan helps to hold water. 1.6 Irrigation\nRice can grow in either a wet (paddy) or a dry (field) setting. (Rice fields are also called paddy fields or rice paddies). About 75% of the global rice production comes from irrigated rice systems because most rice varieties express their full yield potential when the water supply is adequate. In cooler areas, during late spring, water serves also as a heat-holding medium and creates a much milder environment for rice growing. A pond could hold irrigation water to use in the summer when demand for water is the greatest. The bulk of the rice in Asia is grown during the wet season starting in June-July, and dependence on rainfall is the most limiting production constraint for rain-fed culture. Rice areas in South and Southeast Asia may, in general, be classified into irrigated, rain-fed upland, rain-fed shallow water lowland, and rain-fed deepwater lowland areas. The productivity of well-managed, irrigated rice is highest, being in the range of 5-8 t/ha during the wet season and 7-10 t/ha during the dry season if very well managed, but the average is often only in the range of 3-5 t/ha. The productivity of rain-fed upland and deepwater lowland rice, however, continues to be low and is static around 1.0 t/ha. 1.7 Varieties\nThere are more than 40,000 varieties of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), but the exact figure is uncertain. Over 90,000 samples of cultivated and wild rice species are stored at the International Rice Gene Bank, and these are used by researchers all over the world. There are four main types of rice: Indica, Japonica, aromatic, and glutinous. Rice seeds vary in shape, size, width, length, color, and aroma. There are many different varieties of rice: drought-resistant, pest-resistant, flood-resistant, saline-resistant, tall, short, aromatic, sticky, with red, violet, brown, or black; long and slender; or short and round grains. Extensive studies of the varieties have demonstrated that they were independently derived from the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon."

Rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) are divisible into the Indica and Japonica types, or subspecies indica and japonica, which differ in various morphophysiological traits. These two main varieties of domesticated rice (Oryza sativa), one variety, O. sativa indica, can be found in India and Southeast Asia, while the other, O. sativa japonica, is mostly cultivated in Southern China. In general, the rice family can be broken down into three main categories:\n\nLong Grain: Approx. 6-8 mm long, about 3-4 times longer than thick. The endosperm is hard and vitreous. The best long grain varieties come from Thailand, Southern US, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Medium Grain: Approx. 5-6 mm long, but thicker than long grain rice. The endosperm is soft and chalky. It releases about 15% starch into water during cooking. Medium grain rice is mainly grown in China, Egypt, and Italy. Short Grain or Round Grain: Approx. 4-5 mm long, only 1.5-2 times longer than thick. The endosperm is soft and chalky. This variety is grown in subtropical areas like California, Egypt, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, and Portugal. 1.8 Yields\nYield gap is literally defined as the difference between the yield potential of rice and the yields that are actually obtained by farmers. Yield potential of traditional Indica varieties is about 5 t/ha, while the yield potential of crossbreeding Japonica varieties with high-yielding Indica varieties is about 10 t/ha. Yield potential of high-yielding Japonica varieties is about 15 t/ha, while the yield potential of hybrid varieties is about 18 t/ha. The yield gap in irrigated rice production is graphically presented in Figure 1.8. It shows the gap of about 4-6 t/ha in both Tropical (e.g., Philippines) and subtropical climates (e.g., Japan). Figure 1.8: Average Yields in Two Different Climate Conditions Under Different Growing Regimes\n\nAfter the development of IR8 and other high-yielding rice varieties, considerable efforts have been devoted to the development and dissemination of improved technologies for cultivation, in order to fully benefit from the yield potential of the developed varieties. The Green Revolution\nNew \u2018Super Rice\u2019 was released in 2000, featuring a 35% yield increase. Genetic material from corn was inserted into the rice plant.

Figure 1.9 shows that from 1970 to 1985, rice yields in Australia stagnated at around 6 t/ha. After the dissemination of the Rice-Check system in 1986, the Australian national yield increased rapidly and steadily from about 6 t/ha in 1987 to above 9 t/ha in 2000. It was reported that the application of the Rice-Check system also increased nitrogen fertilizer usage efficiency. The rice production systems in Australia and their conditions, however, are very different from those in developing countries. Rice yields vary enormously across ecosystems and countries. Yields of 4\u20136 t/ha are common in irrigated settings, as are yields of 2\u20133 t/ha in rain-fed ecologies. Where rainfall is unreliable and drainage is poor, farmers still grow traditional varieties and use fertilizers in suboptimal amounts because of the uncertainty of obtaining adequate returns from investment in inputs. Recent analyses suggest that growth rates of yields are increasingly differing between and within countries. In three out of four major rice-producing countries, the growth in average yields over the past 20 years is higher than the standard deviation of yield growth by provinces in the respective countries (Table 1.2).

Figures 1.10 & 1.11: Traditional Field Preparation and Transplanting\nFigure 1.12: Germinating Seeds for Seedling Transplanting\nFigure 1.13: Rice Seedling Transplanter\n\n1.10 Why Flooding Rice Fields? The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state and deters any rodents and pests. Consistent water depth has been shown to improve the rice plants' ability to compete against weeds for nutrients and sunlight, reducing the need for herbicides. Rice crops are grown in 5\u201325 cm of water depending on growing conditions. While with rice growing and cultivation,While flooding is not mandatory for rice cultivation, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil. 1.11 Growth Stages\nThe rice plant grows a main stem and a number of tillers. Each rice plant will produce four or five tillers. Being a crop that tillers, the primary tillers (branches) grow from the lowermost nodes of the transplanted seedlings, and this will further give rise to secondary and tertiary tillers. Every tiller grows a flowering head or panicle. The panicle produces the rice grains. Figures 1.14 and 1.14a: Development Stages of the Rice Plant\n\n1.12 Rice Maturation and Harvesting\nRice seedlings grow for 4-5 months to maturity. The plants grow rapidly, ultimately reaching a height of 90 cm (3 feet). By late summer, the grain begins to appear in long panicles on the top of the plant. By the end of summer, grain heads are mature and ready to be harvested. When still covered by the brown hull, rice is known as paddy. Depending on the size of the operation and the amount of mechanization, rice is either harvested by hand or machine."

        "content": "The different harvesting systems are as follows:\n\n1.12.1 Manual Harvesting\nMethods of growing differ greatly in different localities, but in most Asian countries, the traditional hand methods of cultivating and harvesting rice are still practiced. The fields are allowed to drain before cutting. Manual harvesting makes use of sharp knives or sickles, traditional threshing tools such as threshing racks, simple treadle threshers, and animals for trampling. 1.12.2 Combine Harvesting\nCombine harvesters combine all operations: cutting, handling, threshing, and cleaning. In the United States and in many parts of Europe, rice cultivation has undergone the same mechanization at all stages of cultivation and harvesting as have other grain crops. The soil dries out in time for harvest to commence. Farmers use large, conventional grain harvesters to mechanically harvest rice in autumn. Because quality is so important, these harvesters are designed to both gently and rapidly bring the grain in from the fields. 1.12.3 Quality of the Harvested Rice\nHarvest management preserves rice quality and yield, which contribute directly to profit. Timing field draining and harvest are keys to high head rice yields. Other harvesting factors that affect head rice yield include grain moisture content, field rewetting of grain, severe threshing impacts, and excessive foreign matter (trash) in rice. Rice quality may be lower if rice is harvested either at high or low moisture contents. The ends of wet rice kernels grind off and become dust as they are processed. Rice may crack if it dries to below 15% moisture content. Rapid rewetting, once rice reaches 15% or less moisture content, is a key cause for lowered head rice yields. The recommended harvest range to avoid quality or yield reductions is 17 to 21% moisture."

When a soil is flooded, the following major chemical and electrochemical changes take place:\na) Depletion of molecular oxygen\nb) Chemical reduction of soil\nc) Increase in pH of acid soils and decrease in pH of calcareous and sodic soils\nd) Increase in specific conductance\ne) Reduction of Fe\u00b3\u207a to Fe\u00b2\u207a and Mn\u2074\u207a to Mn\u00b2\u207a\nf) Reduction of NO\u2083\u207b to NO\u2082\u207b, N\u2082, and N\u2082O\ng) Reduction of SO\u2084\u00b2\u207b to S\u00b2\u207b\nh) Increase in supply and availability of N, P, Si, and Mo\ni) Decrease in concentrations of water-soluble Zn and Cu\nj) Generation of CO\u2082, methane, and toxic reduction products, such as organic acids and hydrogen sulphide\n\nThese changes will have a profound influence on soil nutrient transformations and availability to rice plants. 2.2 Patterns in Symptomology of Nutrient Deficiency Symptoms in Rice\nInfluence of Nutrient Mobility on Symptomology\nMobile Nutrients:\n\nNitrogen\n\nPhosphorus\n\nPotassium\n\nMagnesium\nDeficiency symptoms appear in the oldest (lower) leaves first because their mobile nutrient contents move to the youngest leaves, which act as sinks. Immobile Nutrients:\n\nCalcium\n\nIron\n\nManganese\n\nZinc\n\nSulfur\nDeficiency symptoms appear in the youngest (upper) leaves first because these nutrients become part of the plant compounds. 2.3 Nitrogen\nNitrogen increases plant height, panicle number, leaf size, spikelet number, and the number of filled spikelets, which largely determine the yield capacity of a rice plant. Panicle number is largely influenced by the number of tillers that develop during the vegetative stage. Spikelet number and the number of filled spikelets are largely determined in the reproductive stage. Farmers use split applications for nitrogen. The number and rate of application can be varied. The ability to adjust the number and rate allows synchronization with real-time demand by the crop. Leaf color charts allow farmers to estimate nitrogen demand by comparing the leaf color to the chart (Figure 2.1). Figure 2.1: Leaf Color Chart\n\nThe initial symptom of nitrogen deficiency in rice is a general light green to yellow color of the plant. It is first expressed in the older leaves because nitrogen is translocated within the plant from the older leaves to the younger ones. Prolonged nitrogen deficiency causes severe plant stunting, reduced tillering (Figure 2.2), and yield reduction (Figure 2.3)."

In a flooded paddy field, ammonium (NH\u2084\u207a) rather than nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) tends to be considered the main source of N for rice. However, in recent years, researchers have paid more attention to the partial NO\u2083\u207b nutrition of rice crops, and their results have shown that lowland rice was exceptionally efficient in absorbing NO\u2083\u207b formed by nitrification in the rhizosphere. The NO\u2083\u207b uptake rate could be comparable with that of NH\u2084\u207a, and it could amount to one-third of the total N absorbed by rice plants. Therefore, although the predominant species of mineral N in bulk soil for paddy rice fields is likely to be NH\u2084\u207a, rice roots are actually exposed to a mixed N supply in the rhizosphere. The growth and N acquisition of rice are significantly improved by the addition of NO\u2083\u207b to a nutrition solution with NH\u2084\u207a alone. The increased N acquisition could be attributed to the increased influx of NH\u2084\u207a by NO\u2083\u207b. 2.3.2 Fertilizer N-Use Efficiency\nIn lowland rice, losses of applied N take place through:\na) Ammonia volatilization\nb) Denitrification\nc) Leaching\nd) Runoff\nThe recovery of fertilizer N applied to rice seldom exceeds 30-40%. Fertilizer N use efficiency in lowland rice may be maximized through better timing of application to coincide with the stages of peak requirement of the crop and placement of N fertilizer in the soil. Other possibilities are the use of controlled-release N fertilizer, e.g., Multicote\u2122 and CoteN\u2122, and the exploitation of varietal differences in N efficiency utilization. In the anaerobic environment of lowland rice soils, the only stable mineral form of N is NH\u2084\u207a. Nitrate (NO\u2083\u207b) forms of N, if applied, will enter the anaerobic zone and be subjected to heavy denitrification losses. At planting time, the base-dressing of N should never be supplied as nitrate. For topdressing the growing plants, however, NH\u2084\u207a and NO\u2083\u207b forms may be used with almost equal efficiency. Fully established rice can rapidly take up applied NO\u2083\u207b before it is leached down to the anaerobic soil layer and can become denitrified."

There is not an exact time to apply early N, but rather a window of a couple of weeks. Once the early N is applied, flooding should be completed as quickly as possible, preferably within five days of the N application. The flood incorporates the N fertilizer into the soil where it is protected against losses via ammonia volatilization and/or nitrification/denitrification as long as a flood is maintained. The flood should be maintained for at least three weeks to achieve maximum uptake of the early applied N (Table 2.2). Table 2.1: Effect of Pre-Flood Nitrogen Application Timing and Soil Moisture on Rice Grain Yields\nTable 2.2: Percent Nitrogen Uptake by Rice Crop at Different Times After N Application\n\n2.3.4 Pre-Flood Application or Split Applications? In order to answer this question, results of a field trial from Missouri, US, support split applications, although inconclusive results exist on whether one or two split applications should be applied, as presented in Table 2.3. All treatments received a total N of 170 kg/ha. The first treatment, which had the recommended nitrogen application, yielded 6,003 kg/ha (119 Bu/acre). The second treatment, which only had one midseason application, yielded 6,053 kg/ha (120 Bu/acre). The third treatment yielded 5,953 kg/ha (118 Bu/acre). The treatment that received 67 kg/ha (=60 lbs/acre) of N yielded 5,549 kg/ha (110 Bu/acre), and the treatment that received 168 kg N/ha (150 lbs.

Rate and timing of N are critical in terms of their effect on yield. 2.3.5 When is N Application Required? Nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for rice production in many countries. Unlike plant nutrients such as P, K, and zinc (Zn), no suitable soil test method has been established and implemented for determining the N-supplying capacity for soils used to produce rice. Rice plants require N during the tillering stage to ensure a sufficient number of panicles. The critical time at active tillering for N application is typically about midway between 14 days after transplanting (DAT) or 21 days after sowing (DAS) and panicle initiation. Figure 2.4: Observed Biomass of Total Above-Ground Dry Matter, Green Leaves, and Stems\n\nAt panicle initiation (about 60 days before harvest of tropical rice), it is critical that the supply of N and K are sufficient to match the needs of the crop. Insufficient N at panicle initiation can result in loss of yield and profit through a reduced number of spikelets per panicle. Insufficient K supply at panicle initiation can result in loss of yield and profit through reduced spikelets per panicle and reduced grain filling. 2.4 Yield Response to N Fertilization\nAn experiment (Bollich and Linscombe) regarding the timing of N application has shown the clear superiority of preplant N application, as shown in Table 2.4. Table 2.4: Yield Response to Time of N Application in Water-Seeded Flooded Cypress Rice\n\nThe least N losses due to leaching or volatilization took place when the only application was closer to the flooding time (Table 2.5). Table 2.5: Rice Yield Response to Time of N Application in Dry-Seeded Rice\n\nNitrogen fertilization improves yields. Field trial responses are 28.4 and 18.9 kg rice per kg N for 25 and 50 kg/ha rates, respectively (Table 2.6). Yield increase is affected by variety, soil N supply capacity, amount of radiation during the reproductive phase, and management practices such as weed control and plant density. Table 2.6: Mean Yield Response to N Fertilization, Entre R\u00edos\n\nTable 2.7: Nitrogen Recommendations by Cultivar and Soil Type\n\nAs Baldo (an Italian variety) is very sensitive to over-fertilization, special attention must be paid to the management of this crop."

At nitrogen rates less than 110 kg/ha, lodging was 3% and lower. At nitrogen rates of 135-170 kg/ha, lodging increased significantly and respectively from 39% to 82%. For each treatment, there were varying rates of pre-flood nitrogen applied and 35 kg N/ha applied at mid-season on all treatments. As Figure 2.5 indicates, an increase in nitrogen up to 135 kg N/ha caused yields to increase. When applied nitrogen levels were higher than 100 kg/ha, lodging increased significantly. Figure 2.5: Effect of Pre-Flood Nitrogen Rates on Grain Yield and Plant Lodging\n\n2.5 Time and Method of Nitrogen Fertilization in Water-Seeded Rice\nUrea is generally the N fertilizer of choice. Most of the nitrogen fertilizer should be applied pre-flood and pre-plant in water-seeded rice if the soil is not allowed to dry during the growing season. Nitrogen fertilizer should be placed either on dry soil and flooded in immediately or shallow incorporated and flooded within 3-5 days. If several days elapse between the period of nitrogen application in ammoniacal form and flooding, much of the nitrogen will convert to nitrate. When the soil is flooded, nitrate is broken down by bacteria and released to the atmosphere as a gas, a denitrification process. Denitrification losses can be avoided by flooding soils within 3-5 days after nitrogen application. These losses are greatest when nitrogen is applied into water on young rice. When most of the nitrogen is applied preplant, rice fields should not be drained, or drained only temporarily. In this situation, if a field must be drained during the growing season, the field should not be allowed to dry out before re-flooding. The field should be maintained in a saturated condition to protect the pre-plant nitrogen. From internode elongation (green ring) through the beginning of head formation, nitrogen must be available in sufficient quantity to promote the maximum number of grains. Nitrogen deficiency at this time reduces the number of potential grains (florets) and limits yield potential. Sufficient nitrogen should be applied pre-plant or pre-flood to assure that the rice plant needs no additional nitrogen until the panicle initiation (green ring) or the panicle differentiation (2 mm panicle) stage. When additional nitrogen is required, it should be topdressed at either of these plant stages or whenever nitrogen deficiency symptoms appear."

When the first crop harvest is after mid-summer, fertilize with 35-50 kg/ha of nitrogen. A higher rate of nitrogen should be applied when conditions appear favorable for good second crop production (minimal field rutting, little or no red rice, healthy stubble). 2.5.2 Recommended N Rates\nNitrogen rates range from 70-200 kg/ha (60\u2013180 lbs/acre) depending upon variety and soil history. N is applied in a 2 or 3-way split: first time just before flooding, then again at about 1 cm internode elongation. The early N application (65-100% of the total N rate) should be applied as an ammonium N source onto dry soil immediately prior to flooding at around the 4- to 5-leaf growth stage. The University of Missouri recommendations for nitrogen are variety-specific. Table 2.8 gives the nitrogen recommendations for four popular varieties. Table 2.8: Nitrogen Recommendations for Four Rice Varieties (kg/ha)\nTable 2.9: Nitrogen Recommendations by Variety\n\nBased on the site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) approach for fertilization of rice (IRRI 2006), a rice crop requires about 50 kg/ha of N fertilizer for each ton in additional grain yield. The optimal amount of fertilizer N required to attain the yield targets of 5.5 MT/ha in the dry season and 6.5 MT/ha in the wet season. This amount of fertilizer N can be split into three applications with an early N application of about 20 to 30% of the total requirement. The remaining 70 to 80% is split into two applications based on the need of the rice crop, as determined from leaf color using the leaf color chart (Figure 2.1). Table 2.10: General Guidelines for Efficient N Management in Rice\n\nThe source of N can increase N efficiency under certain situations. On newly precision-leveled fields, or on low-organic-matter soils, ammonium sulfate (21-0-0-S24) may offer a yield benefit when compared with urea. Ammonium sulfate is also less volatile on high-pH soils compared with urea. 2.6 Phosphorus (P)\n2.6.1 The Role of P in Rice\nProper phosphorus (P) nutrition is critical for producing maximum rice grain yields. Phosphorus is very important in the early vegetative growth stages. Phosphorus promotes strong early plant growth and development of a strong root system. It is important to rice plants because it promotes tillering, root development, early flowering, and ripening."

        "content": "Often P deficiency in rice is referred to as a \"hidden hunger\" because the symptoms are not apparent unless P-deficient plants are directly compared with plants that have sufficient P. When compared with healthy rice of the same age, P-deficient rice is characterized by an abnormal bluish-green color of the foliage with poor tillering and plants that are slow to canopy and slow to mature. When plant comparisons are not available, plant tissue testing is the best tool for diagnosing P deficiency. Rice plants that are deficient in P are stunted and dirty-dark green, and they have erect leaves, relatively few tillers, and decreased root mass. Figure 2.6: Phosphorus Deficiency\n\n2.6.2 The Effect of Soil pH on P Availability\nPhosphorus (P) fertilizer recommendations for rice are currently based on soil testing for available P and soil pH. Phosphorus availability to rice is optimum when the pH is below 6.5. For upland crops, P availability is usually optimal when the soil pH is between 6.0 and 6.5. In acid soils (pH 6.0), the P is associated (\u201ctied up\u201d or \u201cfixed\u201d) with iron and aluminum compounds that are slowly available to most plants. In acid soils, P availability increases following the establishment of the permanent flood due to the chemical changes that occur to the iron phosphate. Thus, more P is available for rice following the flood than is measured with routine soil test methods. In soil where pH is greater than 6.5, the P is primarily associated with calcium and magnesium. Not all calcium and magnesium phosphate compounds are slowly available to plants since their availability declines as pH increases. As a result, P is usually not limiting on acidic soils. In contrast, the availability of calcium phosphates tends to be low and remains low after flood establishment in alkaline soils (pH > 6.5). Under Flooded Conditions:\n\nP is released to the soil solution as Fe\u00b3\u207a-phosphate compounds, which become reduced and convert to Fe\u00b2\u207a-phosphate compounds under low oxygen conditions. On soils low in active Fe or low in total P, sufficient P may not become available. On high pH soils (>7.0), with an abundance of calcium (Ca), the Ca-phosphate compounds may not release adequate P to the soil solution."

However, soil pH is not static and can vary by as much as 1 pH unit, depending on sample time, environmental conditions, and other factors. Application of P fertilizer to undisturbed acid soils that test low in P has failed to show significant yield increases and in some cases has increased lodging, caused rank vegetative growth, and/or decreased yield. Flooding rice soils generally moderates the pH towards a neutral pH condition, thus promoting the availability of soil P.\n\n2.7 P Deficiency Symptoms\nPhosphorus fertilizer should be applied only when recommended by soil test results or when deficiency has been diagnosed. Visual symptoms of P deficiency may not be present in yield-limiting cases. Tissue test whole plants at the pre-flood stage to ensure that adequate P is available to rice plants. Tissue levels should be at least 0.18% P to ensure maximum yields. Phosphorus (P) deficiency symptoms normally appear in the lower part of the plant and result in:\n\nDecreased leaf number\n\nDecreased leaf blade length\n\nReduced panicles per plant\n\nReduced seeds per panicle\n\nReduced filled seeds per panicle\n\nThe reduced tillering capacity for rice planted in a P-impoverished soil is usually the greatest factor responsible for reduced yields.

To account for this loss, a crop removal factor is included for soils testing 35-60 kg/ha of P.\n\nPhosphorus is best applied pre-plant or pre-flood at rates determined via soil tests and yield expectations. When needed, phosphorus fertilizer should be soil-applied when the land is prepared for planting. It is recommended to apply all phosphorus before planting in both water-seeded and dry-seeded rice. If phosphorus fertilizers could not be applied pre-plant, they can be applied before establishing the permanent flood. 2.8 Potassium (K)\n2.8.1 The Role of K\nModern high-yielding rice varieties absorb potassium in greater quantities than any other essential nutrient. In farmers\u2019 fields across Asia, total K uptake rates of a crop yielding 5 t/ha are in the range of 100 kg/ha, of which more than 80% are concentrated in the straw at maturity. For yields greater than 8 t/ha, total K uptake may even exceed 200 kg/ha."

        "content": "2.8.2 K Uptake Process Throughout the Rice Life Cycle\nFigure 2.11: Potassium Uptake Process Throughout the Rice Life Cycle\n\nFigure 2.11 shows that potassium is continuously taken up by the rice plant at a rate described by a sigmoidal curve, which reaches its maximum value during flowering. The potassium is first used for building the leaves' biomass, then for the culms, and later for the grains. Proper potassium (K) nutrition in rice promotes:\n\nTillering\n\nPanicle development (see Figures 2.12 \u2013 2.14)\n\nSpikelet fertility\n\nNutrient uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus\n\nLeaf area and leaf longevity\n\nDisease resistance\n\nRoot elongation and thickness\n\nCulm (stem) thickness and strength\n\nRice plant tolerance to diseases and pests\n\nRice plant resistance to lodging\n\nRecommended K rates are rarely sufficient to balance K removal rates under common commercial conditions. Therefore, most intensive rice production systems have been running under negative K balances, and the negative effects of this have begun to emerge. The situation may be even more aggravated when all the straw is removed from the field, as is the practice in several countries. In some locations, the nutrients removed by the crop are partly returned to the soil system in the form of farmyard manure (FYM). Potassium deficiency occurs to a limited extent in lowland rice. Low potassium content or potassium deficiency is often associated with iron toxicity, which is common on acid latosolic soils and acid sulfate soils. Potassium deficiency also occurs on poorly drained soils, partly because toxic substances produced in highly reductive soils retard potassium uptake and partly because less soil potassium is released under poorly drained conditions. The most important factors that determine the potassium balance of individual fields are soil characteristics, weather (climate), crops, and cultural practices. The yield of any grain crop depends on the number of ears per unit area, the number of ripe grains per ear, and the weight of the grain (frequently called \"1000 grain weight\"). Due to its influence on photosynthesis and assimilate transport, potassium is particularly effective in improving grain number and grain weight. This has been confirmed in pot experiments and in numerous field trials with many cereal crops. See Figures 2.12 & 2.13."

Figure 2.14: Effect of Potassium on Grain Filling in Rice\n\n2.8.3 Rice Response to K Fertilization\nPotassium fertilization field trials increased yields in 20% of the trial sites. The mean yield response was 10.6 kg rice per kg of K\u2082O applied. The general lack of response to K application is attributed to high (greater than 250 ppm) soil exchangeable K content of the rice-growing soils. Only about 10-20% of the total K taken up by the plant is removed in the grain. An average rice yield of 7,567 kg/ha (150 bushels per acre) will only remove approximately 22 kg/ha of K, which is equivalent to about 27 kg/ha of K\u2082O. A mature rice crop, including grain and straw (all above-ground biomass), may weigh 6,800 to 9,000 kg/ha (dry weight) and contain on average 235 kg/ha K. Thus, total crop uptake at this yield level is 284 kg/ha of K\u2082O. Proper potassium (K) nutrition is critical for maximizing rice grain yields. K is very mobile within the rice plant. Studies have shown that supplemental K can be supplied to the rice plant as late as Internode Elongation (IE) and still increase rice grain yields. Whole plant K analysis at IE was better correlated to yield than flag leaf analysis at early boot. The application of sufficient fertilizer K to overcome deficiency of K can increase the efficiency of N fertilizer use. Figure 2.15 illustrates a situation where the rate of N fertilizer application (120 kg/ha) was sufficient with adequate application of fertilizer P and K to achieve a rice yield of 5.7 t/ha. With insufficient K fertilizer, the yield was 5.2-5.4 t/ha only. The application of additional K fertilizer, through an increase in yield with no additional application of N fertilizer, increased the recovery efficiency of the N fertilizer by the rice crop to 37% of the applied N fertilizer."

The deficiency symptoms generally begin to appear near midseason and may be first observed when the plants do not \u201cgreen up\u201d after midseason N applications. As the deficiency progresses, the plants may develop severe disease infestation due to the plants\u2019 reduced ability to resist infection. Diseases that are normally insignificant, such as brown leaf spot and stem rot, may become severe in addition to diseases such as rice blast. While these diseases are typically more severe in K-deficient areas, they are not, by themselves, indications of K deficiency. Potassium is highly mobile in the plant, and deficiency symptoms will always occur first and be most severe on the oldest leaves. Older leaves are scavenged for the K needed by younger leaves. Rice leaf tips of the upper leaves often turn yellow and then brown during hot dry periods; however, these symptoms should not be confused with K deficiency.

Potassium application is recommended based on soil test results, before rice shows K deficiency symptoms during the season, as only low yield benefit, if any, is obtained from K fertilizer application to deficient rice in the mid-to-late boot stage. K fertilizer added at this time probably has little benefit for the current rice crop but will remain in the soil for future crops. Silt and sandy loam soils have a very low buffering capacity, and soil test K can decline rapidly if K fertilizer is omitted for several consecutive crops. Although broadcasting and incorporating the whole K application at the time before planting or pre-flood is generally recommended, split application is also common in some areas.

Results for 21 consecutive cropping seasons (during 10.5 years of intensive cropping from 1995 to 2005) indicate that with balanced fertilization of N, P, and K, grain yield averaged 5.5 t/ha in the dry season and 6.5 t/ha in the wet season. The accumulated loss in grain yield without the application of N fertilizer was 40 t/ha (Figure 2.25). This corresponds to an average grain yield loss of 2 t/ha in each season if N fertilizer was not used. Thus, the use of N fertilizer with appropriate amounts of fertilizer P and K ensured an average additional grain yield of 2 t/ha in each season. Figure 2.24: Effect of N, P, and K on Rice Plant Size\n\nThe corresponding figures for potassium were 10 t/ha yield loss for the experiment period, which means a 0.5 t/ha yield loss for each season if K fertilizer was not applied.

S deficiency has been reported from Bangladesh, Burma, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, and Thailand. Symptoms of S deficiency are very similar to N deficiency symptoms, producing pale yellow plants that grow slowly. However, the main difference is that sulfur is immobile in the plant; therefore, the yellowing will first appear in new leaves rather than older leaves. Most soil sulfur is contained in the soil organic matter. Sulfur deficiencies will frequently occur in the cut and deep-fill areas of newly land-formed fields. In such cases, sulfur deficiencies can usually be avoided by applying a minimum of 112 kg/ha of ammonium sulfate (NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084, between preplant and the 2-3 leaf plant stage. This treatment will provide 23 kg/ha of nitrogen and 26 kg/ha of sulfur."

Of all micronutrients, Zn is required by the largest number of enzymes and proteins. The zinc pathways have important roles in:\n\nPhotosynthesis and sugar formation\n\nProtein synthesis\n\nFertility and seed production\n\nGrowth regulation\n\nDefense against disease\n\n2.11 Secondary Plant Nutrients\n2.11.1 Sulfur (S)\nRole of Sulfur in Rice Plants\nSulfur plays a crucial role in the biochemistry and physiology of the rice plant, particularly in chlorophyll production, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Sulfur Deficiency\n\nGeographical Occurrence: Reported in Bangladesh, Burma, Brazil, Indonesia, India, Nigeria, Philippines, and Thailand. Symptoms: Similar to nitrogen deficiency, causing pale yellow plants with slow growth. However, sulfur is immobile in the plant, so yellowing appears first in new leaves rather than older ones. Soil Sulfur Content\nMost soil sulfur is contained in organic matter. Deficiencies are common in newly land-formed fields, especially in cut and deep-fill areas. Prevention and Treatment\n\nApply a minimum of 112 kg/ha of ammonium sulfate ((NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084) between preplant and the 2-3 leaf stage. This provides 23 kg/ha of nitrogen and 26 kg/ha of sulfur. Regional Recommendations\n\nBangladesh: 20 kg/ha S as gypsum for dry season rice, with residual effects for wet season rice. Application of S with NPK increases grain yield by 30-79%. India: Suggested application of 30 kg/ha S per crop in Delhi and 44 kg/ha S per two crops in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. 2.11.2 Calcium (Ca)\nRole of Calcium in Rice Plants\nCalcium is essential for cell membrane build-up and functioning, as well as cell wall strength.

Seed is the foundation of any rice crop. It must be grown, harvested, and processed correctly for best yield and quality results. Sowing good quality seeds leads to lower seed rate, better emergence (>70%), more uniformity, less replanting, and vigorous early growth which helps to increase resistance to insects and diseases, and decrease weeds. As a result, yield can increase by 5\u221220%. Good seed is pure, from a single variety. Varietal purity tests include looking for percentage of (1) germination, (2) other mixed in varieties, (3) weed seeds and other crop seeds, (4) inert material (stones, soil, etc. ), (5) red rice seeds, and (6) moisture content. list collapse Discoloration\nFungi, bacteria, and environmental conditions such as high humidity and temperature (i.e. 27\u221235\u00b0) cause discoloration. Other rice diseases do not produce consistent discoloration. Any seed having more than 0.5% differently colored or spotted seed surface is considered discolored. Discoloration can occur on fully or partially filled or empty grains. There are two types of discoloration on rice seeds:\n\nSpotting, which is caused by certain diseases (brown spot) or insects (rice bug feeding damage)\nDiscoloration on a portion or portions of rice seeds can be caused by black kernel fungus, stackburn disease, or sheath rot on certain occasions. Red Rice kernels are not acceptable in the rice market place. Kernels should not have more than 25% of its surface area colored red or red streaked. Using a crop calendar allows better planning of all farm activities and the cost of production. A cropping calendar is a schedule of the rice growing season from the fallow period and land preparation, to crop establishment and maintenance, to harvest and storage. The crop calendar allows a farmer to:\n\nplan for input purchase and use\ndevelop cash flow budget for year\ndetermine need credit and period requirement\ndetermine labor requirements and plan for peak usage times\norganize contractors for land preparation and harvesting \nCreate a crop calendar\nDetermine the best date to plant.

How to prepare the rice field for planting\nlandprep-wetpreparation-1Land preparation is important to ensure that the rice field is ready for planting. A well-prepared field controls weeds, recycles plant nutrients, and provides a soft soil mass for transplanting and a suitable soil surface for direct seeding. Land preparation covers a wide range of practices from zero-tillage or minimum tillage which minimizes soil disturbance through to a totally 'puddled' soil which actually destroys soil structure. It typically involves (1) plowing to \"till\" or dig-up, mix, and overturn the soil; (2) harrowing to break the soil clods into smaller mass and incorporate plant residue, and (3) leveling the field. Initial land preparation begins after your last harvest or during fallow period. This is important for effective weed control and for enriching the soil. Generally, it will take 3\u22124 weeks to prepare the field before planting. Clear the field\nAt dry field condition, apply glyphosate to kill weeds and for better field hygiene. Irrigate the field 2\u22123 days after glyphosate application. Maintain standing water at 2\u22123 cm level for about 3\u22127 days or until it is soft enough and suitable for an equipment to be used. Plow or rotovate the field to incorporate stubbles and hasten decomposition. Implements: Power tiller with attached moldboard plow, Hydrotiller, Rotovator\n\nFlood the field. Keep it submerged for at least two weeks. Let the water drain naturally to allow volunteer seeds and weed seeds to germinate. Depending on weed population and soil condition, another tillage operation can be done. Create compost from rice residues\nlandprep-crop-residueComposting converts crop residues into better organic fertilizers. To create a compost:\nEnsure that the field is level, well drained, and under shade. Chop compost materials into small pieces (3\u22125 cm)."

Keep compost heaps moist\u2014not to wet and not too dry. Make sure that no water drains from the compost pile. If rice straw cracks when bent, then the compost must be too dry. Sprinkle compost heap with decaying material (e.g., cow urine), a dilute solution of N fertilizer such as urea, and/or with a micro-organism solution (e.g., tricho). This will decompose the materials faster. Mix and turn the heaps every two weeks. Compost should be ready within 4\u22128 weeks if moisture and temperature conditions are good. Plant cover crops\nGrowing cover crops help suppress weeds and enrich the soil. Crops that can be planted after harvest include nitrogen fixing crops like Sesbania, Azolla, and other legumes such as mung bean and cow pea. How to plant rice\nplanting-manualRice crops can be either direct seeded or transplanted. In direct seeding, seeds are sown directly in the field. While in transplanting, seedlings are first raised in seedbeds before they are planted in the field. When choosing the suitable planting method, the (1) locality, (2) type of soil, (3) rice ecosystem, and (4) availability of inputs and labor, should be considered. Choosing when to plant is crucial to establishing the crop in the field. Timely planting into a well prepared seedbed will help produce a fast growing, uniform crop that will have higher yields and better competition against weeds and other pests. The best time to plant depends on locality, variety, weather, water availability, and the best harvest time. Planting at the same time (or within a 2 week window) as the neighboring fields can help to minimize insect, disease, bird, and rat pressure on individual fields. Direct seeding requires 60\u221280 kg of seeds per ha, while transplanting only requires 40 kg per ha, at 2 plants per hill. How to manage water\nwatermgt-rice-fieldRice is typically grown in bunded fields that are continuously flooded up to 7\u221210 days before harvest. Continuous flooding helps ensure sufficient water and control weeds. Lowland rice requires a lot of water. On average, it takes 1,432 liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system."

Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34\u221243% of the total world\u2019s irrigation water, or about 24\u221230% of the entire world\u2019s developed fresh water resources. Worldwide, water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to its semi-aquatic ancestry, rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages. To effectively and efficiently use water and maximize rice yields, the following good water management practices can be done:\n\nstep1: list-step-1 Construct field channels to control the flow of water to and from your field\nwatermgt-field-channelThe construction of separate channels to move water to and from each field greatly improves the control of water by individual farmers. Field channels allow water to be delivered to the individual seed beds separately and the main field does not need to be irrigated until it's time to plant in the main field. In addition, the ability to control water to your field is important when you need to retain water (especially after applying fertilizer so nutrients are not lost) or when you need to drain the field for harvest. Construction of individual field channels is the recommended practice in any type of irrigation system. step 2: list-step-2 Prepare the land to minimize water loss and create a hard pan\nLarge amounts of water can be lost during land soaking prior to puddling when large and deep cracks are present due to drainage of water down the cracks, beyond the root zone.

Wet land preparation can consume up to a third of the total water required for growing rice in an irrigated production system. If water cost or availability at the time of crop establishment is a concern, consider dry land preparation which uses considerably less water than wet land preparation. Minimize time between operations to reduce water use\n\nIn some canal irrigation systems, the period of time between land soaking for land preparation and planting can be up to 40 days.

After harvest, be sure to clean the harvesting equipment to prevent the spread of infected plants. Some diseases can live on the stubble between seasons and infect a healthy planted crop. In general, plowing after harvest removes stubble that serves as remaining food and shelter for pests, especially insects. In cases where your field was infested, you should remove all stubble from the previous season (see disease section for more details). Clean the bunds and patch all rat holes on bunds and around your field. If there are nearby fallow fields or forested areas, you may want to have a community rat control effort or put up trap barriers to keep rats from damaging your crop (see rat section for more details). Ratooning (allowing your crop to sprout and continue growing after harvest) is not recommended because diseases and insect hosts can be sustained from season to season. It is best to clean the field of any crop and leave it fallow for a few weeks to a few months before planting again. step 2:Use clean seeds and resistant varieties\nCertified seed is recommended but if you can't get certified seed, use clean seed that does not have any discolored seeds, weed seeds or other rice varieties mixed in. Read: Choosing quality seed\nMany varieties have been developed with resistance to different diseases. You should check with your local extension agent or a nearby seed dealer to find out which resistant varieties they carry. Use short-duration and resistant cultivars to decrease insect pest populations. In short-duration cultivars, insects cannot compete as many generations, so populations may not reach damaging levels. Resistant varieties experience less feeding damage on their leaves and stems, which means less entry points for bacteria and fungal diseases. IRRI has a major responsibility to develop rice varieties for the benefit of rice farmers and consumers. step 3: Plant at the same time as your neighbors\nPlanting at the same time (or within a 2 week window) as the neighboring fields can help to minimize insect, disease, bird, and rat pressure on individual fields."

To properly harvest your crops, make sure to:\n\nHarvest at the right time with the right moisture content. Correct timing is crucial to prevent losses and ensure good grain quality and high market value. Grain losses may be caused by rats, birds, insects, lodging, and shattering. Harvesting too early results in a larger percentage of unfilled or immature grains, which lowers yield and causes higher grain breakage during milling. Harvesting too late leads to excessive losses and increased breakage in rice. Harvest time also affects the germination potential of seed. postharvest-harvesting-manualWhen to harvest\n\nDepending on the growth duration of the variety, harvesting time should be around 110\u2212120 DAS for direct seeded rice, and 100\u2212110 DAT for transplanted rice. To determine if the crop is ready for harvest, check for the following indicators:\n\nMoisture content\nGrain moisture content ideally is between 20 and 25% (wet basis). Grains should be firm but not brittle when squeezed between the teeth. Harvest at minimal surface moisture (e.g. from previous rainfall or early morning dew). Read: Measuring moisture content in harvesting\nRipe grains per panicle\nHarvesting should be done when 80\u221285% of the grains are straw colored (i.e., yellow-colored). Number of days after sowing\nGenerally the ideal harvest time lies between 130 and 136 days after sowing for late-maturing variety, 113 and 125 for medium duration, and 110 days for early-maturing varieties. Number of days after heading\nFor dry season harvesting, an optimum time is 28\u221235 days after heading (emergence of panicle tip from leaf sheath). In wet season harvest, optimum time is 32\u221238 days after heading. Avoid delays in threshing after harvesting. Threshing should be done as soon as possible after cutting to avoid rewetting and to reduce grain breakage."

Drying:\npostharvest-drying-manual-2Drying reduces grain moisture content to a safe level for storage. It is the most critical operation after harvesting a rice crop. When rice is harvested, it will contain up to 25% moisture. High moisture level during storage can lead to grain discoloration, encourage development of molds, and increase the likelihood of attack from pests. It can also decrease the germination rate of the rice seed. It is important to dry rice grain as soon as possible after harvesting\u2014 ideally within 24 hours. Delays in drying, incomplete drying or ineffective drying will reduce grain quality and result in losses. Paddy drying methods include traditional and mechanical systems with varying technological complexity and capacities for either farm or commercial level. Traditional drying systems:Traditional drying systems\ndrying-traditional-sun\n\nTraditional drying systems are still practiced in many areas because of its low cost and ease of management. These  include methods, such as:\n\nSun drying - spreading grains under the sun, on mats and pavements\nMat drying - used in small to medium-scale drying where threshed grain are placed on mats, nets, or canvas\nPavement drying - often used in large-scale drying for grain collectors and millers, where grains are laid on pavements specifically made for drying\nField drying and stacking - a method for pre-drying hand-harvested crops before threshing  where farmers  cut rice panicles in the field and stacked them in small piles on top of the crop stubble\nAlthough field drying and stacking is still practiced in some areas, it is not recommended because it can lead to high losses when grains become overdried and shattered. Mechanical Drying systems: Mechanical drying systems\ndrying-mech-dryer\n\nIn this system, mechanical dryers are used to remove water from wet grains by forcing either ambient air or heated air through the grain bulk. This is done through:\n\nHeated air drying - employs high temperatures for rapid drying. The drying process is terminated when the desired final moisture content is reached."

        "content": "In general, it is recommended that rice for food purposes be stored in paddy form rather than milled rice as the husk provides some protection against insects and helps prevent quality deterioration. However, when rice can be stored as brown rice, 20% less storage capacity will be needed. Brown rice is rice grain with its hulls removed but not polished. Under tropical conditions brown rice has a very short shelf life, approximately two weeks\n\nStorage systems: Rice storage facilities take many forms depending on the quantity of grain to be stored, the purpose of storage, and the location of the store. Storage systems can be through bag, bulk, or hermetic containers. Bag storage: In most parts of Asia grain is stored in 40\u221280 kg bags made from either jute or woven plastic. Depending on the size of storage, these bags are normally formed into a stack. When using bag storage consideration needs to be given to the following:\n\nJute bags should not be stacked higher than 4 m and plastic bags 3 m. Plastic bags are more slippery and the stacks will be less stable. Bags should be stacked under cover e.g. under a roof, in a shed or granary or under water proof tarpaulins. A one meter gap should be left between and around stacks and 1.5 m clearance between the top of the stack and the roof. Bags should be stacked on pallets or on an above ground structure to avoid the possibility of absorbing moisture from the floor. Bags should not be stacked on a bed of rice husks or bags filled with rice husks, as these are difficult to keep free from insect infestation. Bags should be stacked so that fumigation can be undertaken easily. The dimensions of the stacks should be set to facilitate sealing with a single fumigation sheet. The efficiency of bag storage can be improved if a hermetic plastic liner bag like the IRRI Super bag is used inside the existing storage bag especially for seeds but also for commerical rice. Some farmers use bag storage in outside granaries, which have been constructed from timber or mud/cement or large woven bamboo or palm leaves."

        "content": "Bulk storage: Farm level bulk storage\nAt farm level grain is often stored in bulk in small outside granaries or in woven baskets or containers made from wood, metal or concrete, which are located under or inside the house. These storages vary in capacity from 200\u22121000 kg. Losses from insects, rodents, birds and moisture uptake are usually high in traditional bulk storage systems. Commercial bulk storage\npostharvest-storage-bulk-commercial\nThe large export mills and collection houses sometimes use metal or concrete silos. These silos range in size from 20\u22122,000 ton capacity. Silos have the advantage that they can be more easily sealed for fumigation and less grain is spilt or wasted.Silos are not very common in Asia because of problems with moisture migration inside the silo which results in hot-spots and molds. Hermetic storage:Sealed or hermetic storage systems are a very effective means of controlling grain moisture content and insect activity for grain stored in tropical regions. By placing an airtight barrier between the grain and the outside atmosphere the moisture content of the stored grain will remain the same as when the storage was sealed. Biological activity inside the sealed container will consume the oxygen and as a result most insects will die. Hermetic storage provides moisture and insect control without pesticides. In hermetically sealed storage systems grains are placed inside an airtight container, which stops oxygen and water movement between the outside atmosphere and the stored grain. Fact sheet: How does hermetic storage work? Types of hermetic storage systems\n\nA hermetic storage system can be made from specially designed PVC containers such as:\n\nCocoon\u2122- commercially available\nthe GrainSafe\u2122\nthe smaller 50kg IRRI Super bags - available to farmers and processors at low cost\nlocally available containers - useful in rural settings, where local containers can be easily converted into hermetic storage systems\nThe size of hermetic storages can range from 3 liters to 2,000 tons. They can be used for paddy, brown rice, and other cereal crops such as maize and also coffee. Larger hermetic systems have also been used with milled rice. Guidelines for safe storage:Good storage systems include (1) protection from insects, rodents and birds, (2) ease of loading and unloading, (3) efficient use of space, (4) ease of maintenance and management, and (5) prevention of moisture re-entering the grain after drying."

Grain and seed stored at moisture contents above 14% may experience the growth of molds, rapid loss of viability and a reduction in eating quality. Good hygiene in the grain store or storage depot is important in maintaining grain and seed quality. To maintain good hygiene in storage:\n\nKeep storage areas clean. This means sweeping the floor, removing cobwebs and dust, and collecting and removing any grain spills. Clean storage rooms after they are emptied and this may include spraying walls, crevices and wooden pallets with an insecticide before using them again. Placing rat-traps and barriers in drying and storage areas. Cats deter and help control rats and mice. Inspect storage room regularly to keep it vermin proof. Inspect the stored seeds once a week for signs of insect infestation. When necessary and only under the direction of a trained pest control technician, the storage room or the seed stock may be sealed with tarpaulin and treated with fumigants. Milling\npostharvest-millingMilling is a crucial step in post-production of rice. The basic objective of a rice milling system is to remove the husk and the bran layers, and produce an edible, white rice kernel that is sufficiently milled and free of impurities. Depending on the requirements of the customer, the rice should have a minimum number of broken kernels. The rice kernel composition\nMost rice varieties are composed of roughly 20% rice hull or husk, 11% bran layers, and 69% starchy endosperm, also referred to as the total milled rice. In an ideal milling process this will result in the following fractions: 20% husk, 8\u221212% bran depending on the milling degree and 68\u221272% milled rice or white rice depending on the variety. Total milled rice contains whole grains or head rice, and brokens. The by-products in rice milling are rice hull, rice germ and bran layers, and fine brokens.

Monitor and replace spare parts regularly\nTurning or replacing rubber rolls, refacing stones, and replacing worn screens regularly will keep milled rice quality high at all times. By-products\nThe main by-products of rice are rice straw, rice husk or hull, and rice bran\nRice strawis produced when harvesting paddy. Straw comes from what is left on the plant after it is harvested and the grains are threshed. Rice husks or hullsare generated during the first stage of rice milling, when rough rice or paddy rice is husked. Rice bran is produced during the second stage in milling, the whitening or polishing process, when the bran layer is removed from the brown rice kernel. Rice straw:What is rice straw? Rice straw is a rice by-product produced when harvesting paddy. Each kg of milled rice produced results in roughly 0.7\u20131.4 kg of rice straw depending on varieties, cutting-height of the stubbles, and moisture content during harvest. Rice straw is separated from the grains after the plants are threshed either manually, using stationary threshers or, more recently, by using combine harvesters (Figure 1). Rice husk:What is rice husk and what are its major products? The rice husk, also called rice hull, is the coating on a seed or grain of rice. It is formed from hard materials, including silica and lignin, to protect the seed during the growing season. Each kg of milled white rice results in roughly 0.28 kg of rice husk as a by-product of rice production during milling. Common products from rice husk are: solid fuel (i.e., loose form, briquettes, and pellets), carbonized rice husk produced after burning, and the remaining rice husk ash after combustion. Rice husk in its loose form (Fig. 2) is mostly used for energy production, such as combustion and gasification. Combustion is the process of burning carbon in the rice husk, which emits CO2 and generates heat energy for further use. One of the most efficient uses of this by-product is its direct combustion without the need for a heat exchanger with a proper furnace  to generate heat for drying paddy. Gasification is the process of converting rice husk to synthesis gas (syngas) in a gasifier reactor with a controlled amount of air. Syngas can be used as fuel for drying and cooking or in a cogeneration system to produce electricity. Rice husk briquettes (Fig."

These densified rice husks are mainly used in industrial boilers as a substitute for fossil fuel. Rice husk ash (Fig. 5) is the remaining by-product after combustion is done. The amount of carbon remaining in ash depends on the combustion performance (i.e., complete or incomplete combustion). Rice husk ash can be used as a soil amendment and as additive in cement and steel, among others. However, only small amounts compared to the total rice husk production are used for such purposes. Carbonized rice husk (Fig. 6) is produced by thermal decomposition of the rice husk under a limited supply of oxygen (O2) and at relatively low temperatures (less than 700\u00b0C). Biochar produced from carbonization can be used as soil amendment, for processing fertilizer, and as activated carbon, etc. Characteristics of the rice husk\nProduced during rice milling, the rice husk is already dried and accumulated at the factory. The specific weight of uncompressed rice husk is about 100 kg/m3. Average properties of rice husk in proximate analysis a and ultimate analysis b are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, according to various research on the rice husk by Beagle (1978), Jeng et al. (2012), and Jenkins (1998). Rice bran:One hundred kilogram (100 kg) of paddy rice will generate approximately 5\u221210 kg of bran. Rice bran is a mixture of substances, including protein, fat, ash, and crude fiber. In many cases, bran contains tiny fractions of rice hull, which increases the ash content of bran. Bran composition is largely dependent on the milling process. In modern rice mills, several different kinds of bran are produced: coarse bran (from the first whitening step), fine bran (from second whitening step) and polish (from the polishing step). Polish consists of part of the endosperm and is often referred to as meal. Rice bran has a high nutritive value. Besides proteins, rice bran is an excellent source of vitamins B and E. Bran also contains small amounts of anti-oxydants, which are considered to low cholesterol in humans. Rice bran contains 10\u221223% bran oil. The oily nature makes bran an excellent binder for animal feeds. Bran oil, once stabilized and extracted, is a high quality vegetable oil for cooking or eating."

Majority of the rice-growing area in hills (under uplands and in jhooms) is under traditional organic cultivation without the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Even in plains where fertilizer is used, the utilization level is much below the national average. Therefore, prospects for organic rice production are good. **Organic Rice Production:**\nOrganic rice production involves recycling of crop residues, crop rotation, inclusion of legumes in the system both in sequence or as intercrop, green manuring, off-farm waste recycling, use of mineral rocks like rock phosphate, mechanical cultivation, and biological and organic pest control. Weed control, soil fertility, and management of pests and diseases are the principal challenges associated with organic rice production. **Photo:**\n- Rice cultivation in hill terraces (left)\n- Rice panicle (right)\n\n---\n\n### **Climatic Requirements**\nIn India, rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice crop generally needs a hot and humid climate. The average temperature requirement throughout the life period of the crop ranges between 21 to 37\u00b0C. At the time of tillering, the crop requires slightly higher temperatures. Temperature requirement for blooming is in the range of 26.5 to 29.5\u00b0C, and ripening time temperature is between 20 and 25\u00b0C. ---\n\n### **Soil**\nRice can be grown under any type of soil reaction varying from acidic to alkaline. Soil having good water retention capacity with a good amount of clay and organic matter is ideal. Well-drained, loamy, and light alluvial soils with a pH of 5.0 to 6.5 are most suitable for proper growth and productivity. ---\n\n### **Varieties**\n#### **Low Latitude:**\n- IR 64, Naveen, Gomati Dhan, Ranjit, RC-Maniphou-4, RC-Maniphou-5, RC-Maniphou-7, RC Maniphou 10, TRC Borodhan-1, DR 92, Shahsarang 1, Lampnah, etc. - **Aromatic and Fine Grain Rice:** Joha, Kalikhasa, Harinarayan. #### **Mid Altitude:**\n- **Upland:** Bhalum-1, Bhalum-2, Bhalum-3, Bhalum-4, Iuron, and IET 20204. - **Lowland:** Shahsarang-1, IR-64, Lampnah, VD-82, Krishma Hamsa, Mendri, Manipuri."

It is suitable for loamy and clayey soils. - One crop of dhaincha can add 10-20 tonnes of biomass per hectare. - For sowing one hectare of area, 20-25 kg of seed is required. - It can fix about 75-80 kg N per hectare, depending on the environmental conditions. ---\n\n### **Methods of Application of Biofertilizers**\n#### **Azospirillum:**\n- **Seed Treatment:** Mix the carrier-based inoculum 200 g in 200 ml of rice gruel to make a slurry, which is sufficient to treat 10 kg of seed. The seeds are mixed in the slurry so as to have a uniform coating of the inoculum over the seeds and then shade-dried for 30 minutes. The shade-dried seeds should be sown within 24 hours. Biorganic RF 79 (biofertilizer) developed at ICAR Complex, Umiam @ 40 ml/L for seed treatment has been found to increase rice productivity by about 15%. - **Main Field Application:** Two kilograms of Azospirillum is mixed with 50 kg of dried powdered farmyard manure and then broadcast in one hectare of the main field just before transplanting. #### **Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB):**\n- Carrier-based phosphobacteria can be applied as seed treatment and field application, as in the case of Azospirillum. #### **Azolla Green Manure:**\n- Azolla can be applied as green manure for rice before transplanting. For this, Azolla is grown 15-20 days before transplanting of rice by applying 1-2 tonnes of fresh inoculum per hectare in a well-prepared field. Rock phosphate is applied @ 62.5 kg/ha in three equal splits at an interval of seven days. After the formation of a thick mat, water is drained out, and the field is ploughed for incorporating Azolla. #### **Azolla Dual Culture:**\n- Growing Azolla along with rice is more easy and feasible. Azolla technology is very efficient in terms of nitrogen fixation and biomass accumulation during the rabi season due to better environmental conditions for its vegetative multiplication. It can also be used for the late kharif season."

Inoculation of fresh biomass of Azolla @ 200 kg/ha could multiply faster and cover the rice field as a green mat in 2-3 weeks with 15-20 tonnes of biomass accumulation. - Azolla is incorporated at the time of the first weeding. It can be done with a weeder or left for self-decomposition. Azolla decomposes in the flooded rice field in 2-3 weeks. - During the incorporation of Azolla, the leftover fronds float on the water surface, which multiply and cover the rice field. Again, 2-3 incorporations are possible. - The cultivation of Azolla not only supplies biomass and N but also contributes K, P, Ca, S, Zn, and Fe. The suppression of weed growth is another added advantage of Azolla cultivation along with rice. ---\n\n### **Water Management**\n#### **Transplanted Rice:**\n- Continuous submergence of 2-5 cm during crop growth (transplanting to maturity) gave higher yield. This practice helps to suppress weed growth right from the beginning. - Water is drained out during fertilizer application. The depth of water should not exceed 5 cm in the field, particularly at the tillering stage of the crop. - Higher depth of water during tillering reduces the number of tillers/hill, causing a reduction in yield. - After the completion of tillering, the field should be drained out for a week and reflooded again. This will result in a higher number of effective tillers/hill. - In any case, there should not be any water stress during the panicle initiation to grain filling stage. - Irrigation should be stopped 3-4 weeks before harvesting the crop. - Under SRI practice, no flooding is needed, and the field is kept saturated. No standing water is to be maintained during tillering up to panicle initiation. Intermittent wetting and drying until the panicle initiation stage is desirable. The period of drying and wetting can range from 2-7 days. #### **Direct Seeded Rice:**\n- Cultivation of crops in topo-sequence helps in better utilization of water in hill slopes and terraces. - While rice is cultivated in terraces or slopes, it should be grown in the lower portion of the hill slope where runoff concentrates. - Water harvesting in-situ in flat or terrace land can be done by providing peripheral bunding to increase crop yield. - Saturation and submergence are equally effective for direct-sown rice."

Flooding will be more effective if fields are precision-leveled. Leveling makes the water depth uniform and facilitates rapid flow onto and from the field. - **Dual Cropping of Rice with Azolla:** Reduces weed problems and improves productivity through the addition of macro and micronutrients. - **Releasing Ducklings:** Releasing about 20 ducklings/ha also keeps the weeds at a minimal level and increases rice yield. ---\n\n### **Pest and Disease Management**\nThe incidence of pests and diseases in properly managed organic fields is generally low. This is because of resistant varieties, cultural practices like crop rotations, time of planting, balanced nutrition, proper water management, clean field bunds, and the removal of infested leaves and plants. Selection of healthy and clean seed materials may also keep the problem of diseases and pests at a minimal level. The pests and diseases in rice can be kept below the economic threshold limit (ETL) by using the following strategies:\n\n#### **A. Cultural and Mechanical Strategies:**\n1. Use of disease-free and disease-resistant/tolerant varieties. 2. Inoculating seeds with Azotobacter, Azospirillum, and treating with Trichoderma viride for protection against seed and soil-borne diseases in upland direct-seeded crops. 3. Adopt green manuring and adequate use of organic manures. 4. Grow legumes frequently and incorporate them into the soil at a tender stage. 5. Decomposing organic manures suppress the nematode population. 6."

White or transparent patches on leaves, pinholes, damaged leaves easily break from the wind, somewhat distorted leaves, clear or yellow spots on inner margins of emerging leaves, stunting of plants with few tillers. - **Management:** There is no cultural control for rice whorl maggot. Small beneficial insects such as wasps can parasitize its eggs, Dolicopodid flies prey on the eggs, and ephydrid flies and spiders feed on the adults. Therefore, manage diversity and conditions for the proliferation of such beneficial insects. The rice plant can compensate for the damage caused by the rice whorl maggot with growth. Usually, the symptoms disappear during the maximum tillering stage of the crop. #### **2."

Dead hearts and whiteheads symptoms may sometimes be confused with damages caused by rats, neck blast, and black bug diseases. To confirm stem borer damage, visually inspect rice crops for dead hearts in the vegetative stages and whiteheads in reproductive stages. Stems can be pulled and dissected for larvae and pupae for confirmation of stem borer damage. - **Management:** Grow resistant varieties. Clip the tip of seedlings before transplanting to eliminate egg masses. Avoid close planting and continuous water stagnation at early stages. Collect and destroy the egg masses. Pull out and destroy the affected tillers. Set up light traps to attract and kill the moths. Harvest the crop up to the ground level and disturb the stubbles with a plough immediately after harvest. Release the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma japonicum, on 30 and 37 DAT twice @ 5 ml/ha/release. Apply Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki and neem seed kernel extract in combination of 2.5 kg and 1% to reduce oviposition by the stem borer. **Photo:** Dead heart in rice. ---\n\n#### **4. Rice Bug (Leptocorisa oratorius, L. varicornis, and L. acuta):**\n- **Symptoms:** Rice bugs damage rice by sucking out the contents of developing grains from pre-flowering spikelets to the soft dough stage (milky stage)."

Ducks can be allowed in the field to pick up the bugs. Planting fields within a village at the same time (synchronous planting) helps reduce rice bug problems. Foliar spray of neem seed kernel extract 5%, Notchi leaf powder extract 5%, Ipomoea leaf powder extract 5%, or Prosopis leaf powder extract 5% helps keep the problem under control. Panchgavya 3% has also been found effective. ---\n\n#### **5. Brown Plant Hopper (Nilaparvata lugens):**\n- **Symptoms:** Crescent-shaped white eggs inserted into the midrib or leaf sheath, white to brown nymphs, and brown or white adults feed near the base of tillers. Leaves turn yellow and later brownish \"Hopper burn.\" Presence of honeydew and sooty molds at the basal parts is a characteristic symptom. Infestation is more severe during the panicle initiation stage. - **Management:** Use resistant varieties. Avoid close planting and provide 30 cm rogue spacing at every 2.5 m to reduce pest incidence. Control irrigation by intermittent draining. Set up light traps to monitor pest population and control. Release natural enemies like Lycosa pseudoannulata and Cyrtorhinus lividipennis. Spray neem seed kernel extract 5% (25 kg/ha) or neem oil 2% (10 liters/ha) after draining the water and direct the spray jet towards the base of plants. Foliar spray of Verticillium lecanii @ 5 gm/liter of water is also effective. **Photo:** Brown Plant Hopper (left), Damage by gall midge (right). ---\n\n#### **6. Gall Midge (Orseolia oryzae):**\n- **Symptoms:** Formation of a hollow cavity or tubular gall at the base of the infested tiller. The gall formed is a silvery white hollow tube, 1 cm wide and 10\u221230 cm long. Affected tillers inhibit the growth of leaves and fail to produce panicles. Deformed, wilted, and rolled leaves, elongation of leaf sheaths, also called onion leaf or silver shoot. Plants get stunted. To clearly identify and not get confused with other pest symptoms, check for the presence of insects, particularly elongate-tubular eggs and maggot-like larvae feeding inside developing buds."

Gradually turn into yellow and straw-colored stripes with wavy margins. In the early morning in humid areas, yellowish, opaque, turbid drops of bacterial ooze may be seen. In the Kresek (wilt) phase, leaves roll completely, droop, and plants die completely. - **Management:** Balanced fertilization. Ensure good drainage of fields and nurseries. Keep fields clean. Remove weed hosts. Allow fallow fields to dry to suppress disease agents in the soil and plant residues. Seed and soil application of Trichoderma viride and Bacillus subtilis has also been found to manage the disease. Use 10 gm each for 1 kg seed treatment and 2.5 kg each/ha mixed with 300-500 kg FYM/compost for soil treatment. ---\n\n#### **11. Rice Blast (Pyricularia grisea (P. oryzae)):**\n- **Symptoms:** The disease can infect paddy at all stages and all aerial parts of the plant. Leaves and neck infections are more severe.

It has been found that rice + soybean (4:2 row ratio) and rice + groundnut (4:2 row ratio) are promising in NEH regions. Wherever possible, rice should be rotated with leguminous crops for improving soil health and sustaining rice productivity. - Under high-altitude conditions, monoculture of rice is prevalent, but the cropping sequence of potato-rice is recommended. - Under mid and low altitudes, rice-mustard, rice-pea/lentil is recommended. - In irrigated conditions of Manipur and Tripura, rice-rice-pea/lentil/toria as rainfed is in practice. - Rice + tomato, rice - tomato, rice + chillies, rice-chillies, rice-mustard, rice-French bean, rice-carrot, etc., are recommended on raised and sunken bed systems under wet and marshy valley land of Meghalaya or elsewhere in the NEH Region. - Under raised and sunken bed systems of cultivation in lowlands and valley lands, rice-rice or rice-pulses on sunken beds and rice-vegetables on raised beds have very good potential for higher productivity and income. ---\n\n### **Harvesting**\n- Rice attains maturity at around 30 days for early and 40 days for medium to late-maturing varieties after 50% heading in low and mid-altitude areas. In high-altitude areas, it may take some more time to attain maturity. - Harvesting is done at the yellow ripening stage to avoid shattering loss in the field. - SRI rice matures 12-15 days earlier than conventional and 7-10 days earlier than ICM."

No sentences or data have been lost, and the structure is detailed and organized:\n\n---\n\n### **How to Manage Water**\n\n#### **Water Management in Rice Fields**\n- **Rice Growth Conditions**:  \n  Rice is typically grown in bunded fields that are continuously flooded up to 7\u221210 days before harvest. Continuous flooding helps ensure sufficient water and control weeds. - **Water Requirements for Lowland Rice**:  \n  Lowland rice requires a lot of water. On average, it takes 1,432 liters of water to produce 1 kg of rice in an irrigated lowland production system. Total seasonal water input to rice fields varies from as little as 400 mm in heavy clay soils with shallow groundwater tables to more than 2000 mm in coarse-textured (sandy or loamy) soils with deep groundwater tables. Around 1300\u22121500 mm is a typical amount of water needed for irrigated rice in Asia. - **Global Water Usage for Rice**:  \n  Irrigated rice receives an estimated 34\u221243% of the total world\u2019s irrigation water, or about 24\u221230% of the entire world\u2019s developed freshwater resources. Worldwide, water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce. Due to its semi-aquatic ancestry, rice is extremely sensitive to water shortages. ---\n\n### **Good Water Management Practices**\n\n#### **Step 1: Construct Field Channels**\n- **Purpose**:  \n  The construction of separate channels to move water to and from each field greatly improves the control of water by individual farmers. Field channels allow water to be delivered to the individual seedbeds separately, and the main field does not need to be irrigated until it's time to plant in the main field. - **Benefits**:  \n  The ability to control water to your field is important when you need to retain water (especially after applying fertilizer so nutrients are not lost) or when you need to drain the field for harvest. Construction of individual field channels is the recommended practice in any type of irrigation system."

        "content": "---\n\n#### **Step 2: Prepare the Land to Minimize Water Loss and Create a Hard Pan**\n- **Crack Management**:  \n  Large amounts of water can be lost during land soaking prior to puddling when large and deep cracks are present due to drainage of water down the cracks, beyond the root zone. Till the soil to fill cracks. Perform shallow tillage operations before land soaking. This fills in the cracks and can greatly reduce the amount of water used in land preparation. - **Puddling**:  \n  For clayey soils that form cracks during the fallow period, puddling results in a good compacted hard pan. For coarse sandy soils, puddling may not be effective. For heavy clay soils, puddling may not be necessary to reduce water losses because of the low infiltration rate of such soils; however, puddling may still be necessary if the soil was cracked prior to primary tillage, if weeds are present prior to transplanting, or if the soil is too hard or cloddy for transplanting after soaking. - **Water Consumption**:  \n  Despite reducing water loss, the action of puddling itself consumes water. There is a trade-off between the amount of water used for puddling and the amount of water \u201csaved\u201d during the crop growth period because of a compact hard pan. Wet land preparation can consume up to a third of the total water required for growing rice in an irrigated production system. - **Dry Land Preparation**:  \n  If water cost or availability at the time of crop establishment is a concern, consider dry land preparation, which uses considerably less water than wet land preparation. - **Minimizing Time Between Operations**:  \n  In some canal irrigation systems, the period of time between land soaking for land preparation and planting can be up to 40 days. To minimize time between operations:  \n  - Install field channels. - Use common/community seedbeds. - Plant nearby fields at the same time. - Practice direct wet seeding. ---\n\n#### **Step 3: Level the Field**\n- **Importance of Leveling**:  \n  A well-leveled field is crucial to good water management. An unleveled field requires an extra 80\u2212100 mm of water to give complete water coverage. This is nearly an extra 10% of the total water requirement to grow the crop. - **Leveling Implements**:  \n  - **Draft Animal**:  \n    When moving soil from high to low areas, weight will need to be added to the leveling harrow/board."

        "source": "knowledgebase",
        "content": "Standing on the harrow drawbar should provide sufficient weight (a ratio of 40 kg weight/meter width of leveling board gives the best results). Leveling with an animal requires total water coverage of the field and takes twelve days to level one hectare. To get the best results, the procedure should be repeated the next year (the time required will be much less and can be done at the normal plowing time). - **2-Wheel Tractor**:  \n    When moving soil from high to low areas, weight will need to be added to the leveling harrow/board. You can either lean on the handles or stand on the harrow to provide sufficient weight. Position the tractor at the high part of the field, lean on the handles to add weight to the harrows, and drag soil to the lower part of the field. Take the weight off the harrows and return to the higher parts of the field. When first starting, it may be best to use the harrow without the leveling board attached. When using the attached leveling board, make sure the harrow teeth are exposed, as this will help remove the weeds and quickly make the soil and water into slurry. It will take at least 7-8 days to semi-level one hectare in the first year (repeat in the second year, but less time is required). - **4-Wheel Tractor**:  \n    If leveling with water in the field, the water can be used to mark high and low areas. In dry conditions, a topographic survey needs to be taken to reveal high and low areas. All surface residues need to be cut up or removed to ease soil flow from the drag bucket. Level with a rotovator blade in wet conditions or a drag bucket in dry conditions (both can be fitted with a laser level attachment). Start at the highest point and drag soil to the lowest areas. It is best to add small wings to the end of the rotovator to improve the movement of soil. Weight may also need to be added to the blade to improve the cutting ability. When returning to the high places, lift the cutting blade above the ground level. Depth control wheels on the rotovator/bucket make it more uniform. In wet areas where there is poor traction or a chance of bogging the tractor, it may be better to push the soil rather than drag the soil."

        "content": "It will take one day to level one hectare in the first year using a rotovator and half a day per hectare using a drag bucket. - **Laser Leveling**:  \n  Laser leveling results in a precisely leveled field, resulting in more evenly maturing crops, higher yields, and reduced water and agro-chemical use. - **Step 1: Plow the Field**:  \n    Plow the field from the center of the field outwards when the soil is moist. Dry soil requires a significant increase in tractor power. Disc or moldboard plow may be needed in hard soil conditions. Disc harrows or tine implements are ideal for secondary workings. All surface residues need to be cut up or removed to aid soil flow from the bucket. - **Step 2: Take a Topographic Survey**:  \n    Take a topographic survey of the field, then draw a diagram noting high and low areas. Using the surveyed readings, establish the mean height of the field. Based on the field diagram and mean height, determine the strategy to effectively move soil. - **Step 3: Check and Calibrate the Laser Transmitter**:  \n    Periodically check the laser transmitter for accuracy. All checking and calibration procedures are done at the zero slope reading. - **To Check Accuracy**:  \n      - Use a suitable tripod that allows you to rotate the transmitter in 90-degree increments. - Ensure a minimum 65-meter range that is unobstructed and as close to flat as possible. - Mount the unit on a tripod at one end of the 60 m range and level it. Set X and Y-axis grade counters at zero. With auto-leveling transmitters, turn the transmitter control switch to the AUTO position and wait for the Auto Mode Indicator Lamp to stop flashing. - Station a rodman with a receiver at the other end of the range 60 m away. - Align the laser, using the sighting scope or groove, such that the \u201cX\u201d is pointed directly at the rodman. Ensure the pentamirror is rotating and the Auto Mode Indicator Lamp has stopped flashing (if appropriate). - Have the rodman take a precise reading to within 2 mm and mark the reading as X1. - Rotate the transmitter 180 degrees and wait at least 2 minutes for it to re-level. In non-auto-leveling transmitters, manually re-level the transmitter. Have the rodman take another accurate reading and mark it down as X2."

        "source": "knowledgebase",
        "content": "- If the difference between X1 and X2 is less than 6 mm, no adjustment is necessary, and the laser can be assumed to give the correct reading. - If the difference is between 6 mm and 38 mm, the transmitter needs to be calibrated and this can be done locally in the field. See calibration of the transmitter. - If the difference is 38 mm or greater, the unit must be re-calibrated at an authorized service center. You cannot recalibrate it in the field without damage to the unit. - **To Calibrate Transmitter**:  \n      - From the two previous readings, calculate the \u201cX\u201d average = (X1 + X2)/2 and have the rodman adjust the detector on the rod to the \u201cX\u201d average. (Center the detector between the two readings). - Locate the \u201cX\u201d calibration screw and adjust it to align the beam to the \u201cX\u201d average at the detector. If gentle turning of the calibration screw cannot align the beam, return the unit to an authorized service center for calibration. - After adjusting the beam, allow for the unit to stabilize before taking the next reading, then repeat the entire above procedure to check your work and do a fine readjust if necessary to get it just right. - After adjusting the \u201cX\u201d axis, rotate the transmitter 90 degrees to the \u201cY\u201d axis. Point the \u201cY\u201d axis directly at the rodman, using the sighting scope or groove, and repeat the above steps. Call the readings Y1 and Y2 and calculate the \u201cY\u201d axis average as you did in step 7. - The same procedure may be employed by directing the beam onto a wall 60 m away. Instead of having the rodman recording on the staff, make a mark on the wall at X1 and X2 and then draw a line in the center. The beam is then adjusted until it is recorded at the centerline. This system is useful if there is no rodman available or a measuring staff is not available. - **Step 4: Level the Field**:  \n    The laser-controlled bucket should be positioned at a point that represents the mean height of the field. For a rotovator, set the cutting blade slightly above ground level (1\u20132 cm). Drive the tractor in a circular direction from the high areas to the lower areas in the field."
    },
    {
        "source": "knowledgebase",
        "content": "When the whole field has been covered in this circular manner, do a final leveling pass in long runs from the high end of the field to the lower end. In wet areas where there is poor traction or a chance of bogging the tractor, carefully fill the wet areas from the affected edge in a circular motion. Depending on the amount of soil that must be moved, it is possible to level one to two hectares per day using a 50 kW tractor and a two-meter-wide bucket. - **Step 5: Re-survey the Field**:  \n    Re-survey the field to make sure the desired level of precision has been attained. If done properly, laser leveling should not be needed for another 4 years. A light tillage should follow leveling to loosen the soil for planting. ---\n\n#### **Step 4: Construct Bunds and Repair Any Cracks or Holes**\n- **Importance of Bunds**:  \n  Good bunds are a prerequisite to limit water losses. Bunds should be well compacted, and cracks or rat holes should be plastered with mud at the beginning of the crop season to limit water loss. Bunds should be high enough (at least 20 cm) to avoid overflowing during heavy rainfall. Lower levees of 5\u221210 cm height in the bunds can be used to keep the ponded water depth at that height. These levees can be heightened with soil when more stored water is needed. - **How to Construct Bunds**:  \n  - Construct no wider and taller than 50 cm x 30 cm bunds around the field. - Ensure that bunds are well compacted and properly sealed, with no cracks, holes, etc. This will minimize water losses through seepage (particularly in sloping lands). - Adjust the spillway height to 3\u22125 cm for storing the same depth of water. Maintain this height to ensure sufficient water storage capacity, especially during the rainy or wet season. - For rat control, construct 30 cm x 30 cm bunds. ---\n\n### **Water Management for Different Crop Establishment Methods**\n\n#### **Continuous Flooding**\n- **Transplanting**:  \n  Continuous flooding of water generally provides the best growth environment for rice. After transplanting, water levels should be around 3 cm initially and gradually increase to 5\u221210 cm (with increasing plant height) and remain there until the field is drained 7\u221210 days before harvest."
    },
    {
        "source": "knowledgebase",
        "content": "- **Direct Wet Seeding**:  \n  For direct wet-seeded rice, the field should be flooded only once the plants are large enough to withstand shallow flooding (3-4 leaf stage). ---\n\n#### **Safe Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)**\n- **Transplanting**:  \n  Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) can be started a few weeks (1-2) after transplanting. Irrigate and then allow the water depth to drop to 15 cm below the surface using a field water tube to monitor the water level depth. Once the water level has dropped to 15 cm below the surface, re-flood the field to a depth of 5 cm above the surface and repeat. From one week before to one week after flowering, the field should remain flooded. After flowering, during grain filling and ripening, the water level can drop to 15 cm below the surface before re-flooding. When many weeds are present, AWD should be postponed for 2-3 weeks to assist suppression of weeds by ponded water and to improve the efficacy of herbicide. - **Policy Brief**:  \n  AWD reduces greenhouse gas emissions and saves water. - **Direct Seeded Rice**:  \n  Keep the soil moist but not saturated from sowing till emergence to avoid seeds from rotting in the soil. After sowing, apply a flush irrigation to wet the soil if there is no rainfall. Saturate the soil when plants have developed three leaves, and then follow the safe Alternate Wetting and Drying practices as described above. ---\n\n#### **Water Scarcity Management**\n- **Sensitivity at Flowering Stage**:  \n  Lowland rice is extremely sensitive to water shortage (below saturation) at the flowering stage. Drought at flowering results in yield loss from increased spikelet sterility, thus fewer grains. Keep the water level in the fields at 5 cm at all times from heading to the end of flowering. - **Water-Saving Technologies**:  \n  In case of water scarcity, apply water-saving technologies such as Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and consider changing the planting method from puddled transplanting to non-puddled transplanting or dry-direct seeding. ---"

Despite being grown in a variety of agro-climatic areas, rice is the most commonly used food in Southeast Asia. In India, rice planting is typically farmed in six distinct habitats, including coastal lowlands, deep water areas, rainfed lowlands, rainfed uplands, irrigated kharif and irrigated rabi. Gain a thorough understanding of how to grow paddy crops to boost your farm productivity. Rice Crop at a Glance\nBotanical Name: Oryza sativa\n\nCommon Name: Rice (English), Dhaan (Hindi), Nel (Tamil), Nellu (Malayalam), Vari (Telugu). Crop Season: All seasons [Kharif, Rabi and Summer]\n\nSoil Requirements for Paddy Cultivation\nPaddy planting can be done in a range of soil types, from sandy loams to clay soils. The best soil for the cultivation of rice crops is clay loams. Although rice crops can withstand a wide range of soil reactions, it may prefer acidic soils with a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Climatic Requirements for Paddy Cultivation\nFor successful rice planting, maintaining the ideal temperature is crucial. Rice is best suited for areas with warm and humid climates. Paddy crop performs better at a temperature range of 21\u02daC to 38\u02daC and it can tolerate up to 40 \u030aC. It is a short day plant and if long days appear at the reproductive phase it delays flowering. Package of Practices for Rice/Paddy Cultivation\nSeedbed Preparation of Nursery\nDry Seed Bed\n\nSelect suitable land near the water source in the middle of June and December for kharif and rabi crops, respectively. Plough the soil 3-4 times and use a rotavator after two ploughings for fine tilth and level properly. For a 1000m2 nursery area in rice planting, apply fertilizer at the rate of 10 kg N, 2kg P2O5 and 2kg K2O. About one-tenth of the main field is required as a nursery. Wet Seed Bed\n\nPloughing should be done 4 to 5 times till the desired tilth is obtained. Divide the plot into sub-plots of 1m*10m size by making drainage channels on all four sides. Apply 5kg urea, 10kg SSP and 5kg MOP before levelling per bed of 10m2 area. Dapog Nursery\n\nDapog method of raising nursery consists of growing seedlings on raised soil bed covered with polyethelene sheets."

        "content": "To establish a healthy paddy planting, sow pre-germinated seeds on top of the nursery cover, with a recommended rate of one kg per sq. meter. A nursery area of 25 to 35 sq.m. of the area is enough to raise seedlings for 1 hectare. Seedlings raised by this method get ready for transplanting within 13 to 14 days. In case of zinc deficiency, a 0.5% solution of zinc sulphate heptahydrate should be sprayed. Selection of Paddy Seed\nPrepare a salt solution (60 gm in 1-litre water) and place the seed in the container of salt solution. The seeds that float upon soaking should be removed. Dry the soaked seed under the shade.

In the wet seed bed condition, this can be done at the time the seed is soaked for sprouting (or) soak the 10 kg seed in 20 litres of water containing Taqat Fungicide (Hexaconazole 5% + Captan 70% WP) at the rate of 2 gm/litre water to prevent from rice blast. Nursery Management\nAfter 24 hrs of seed soaking drain the water, and cover the seed in a gunny bag for germination. Sow the sprouted seeds in the nursery bed and keep the beds moist for the first few days. Maintain a shallow layer of water after seedlings are about 1 inch in height. Main Field Preparation of Paddy/Rice\nPrepare the land well by using a tractor-drawn plough in dry conditions. It can be done during pre-monsoon rain or immediately after the harvest of the second crop. This will reduce pest and weed incidence. Puddle the field twice at a 7-day interval and level the land after each puddling. Puddling is a process of churning the soil in standing water. This results in the formation of the impervious layer which reduces deep percolation losses. The system of rice intensification is the process of rice cultivation by adopting a square geometry. In this method of paddy cultivation, young seedlings of 8 to 12 days old (2-leaf stage) should be raised in moist soil (saturated)."

For paddy planting in zinc-deficient areas, apply zinc sulphate at a rate of 25 kg/ha as a basal application. Irrigation Water Management\nKeep the rice farm under saturated condition for a week after transplanting for establishment and growth of roots. Maintain a water level of 3 to 5 cm during the entire paddy crop growth period, after that field should be drained prior to top dressing and irrigated after 24 hours. In paddy cultivation, the most critical stages of water requirement are panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling stages. In general, rice crops require a 1200 mm depth of water during the crop growing season. Irrigation should be stopped in rice cultivation during the last 10 to 15 days before harvesting. Weed Management of Paddy Crop\nDuring the initial 4 to 6 weeks of paddy planting, weed competition poses the greatest challenge for rice growth. Apply Craze (Pretilachlor 50% EC) at 500 ml/acre or NACL-Eraze Strong (Bensulfuron Methyl 0.6% + Pretilachlor 6% GR) at the rate of 4 kg/acre as pre-emergence to control weed emergence within 2 to 3 days of transplanting.

        "content": "DESCRIPTION: Cultivated rice is an annual grass. Depending on the degree of photosensitivity its growth duration may range from 60 to more than 200 days. It has round; jointed culm with long narrow leaves. The culm terminates in an inflorescence called a panicle. The height of the culm may vary from 20 cm to over 5 m in some deep-water rice exhibiting excellent internode elongation ability.Three types of roots are recognized in rice e.g. seminal roots, mesocotyl roots and nodal or adventitious roots. Seminal roots grow out of radicle and are temporary in nature. The radicle emerges after germination. It elongates to about 15 cm and remains functional up to seventh leaf stage. Mesocotyl roots emerge from the axis between the node of the coleoptile and base of radicle. Mesocotyl roots do not grow under normal circumstances. However, under deep seeding conditions emergence of mesocotyl roots are promoted. The rice root system is essentially adventitious, fibrous and arises from the compressed basal nodes. Roots that develop directly from the nodes are called primary roots. Primary roots produce branched secondary roots, which in turn give rise to tertiary roots and so on. The roots, which develop from nodes below the soil surface, are called crown roots and roots that develop from nodes above the soil surface are referred to as nodal roots. Nodal roots are often found in rice cultivars growing at water depth above 80 cm. Most rice varieties reach a maximum depth of 1 m or deeper in soft upland soils. In flooded soils, however rice roots seldom exceed a depth of 40 cm. Aerobic root environments, as in case of upland rice, promote development of root hairs whereas anaerobic condition as in flooded rice, retard the development of root hairs.The rice stem is known as culm. The culm is made up of a series of nodes and internodes. The node bears a leaf and in its axil between the sheath pulvinus and nodal septum a bud which may grow into a tiller. The region between two nodes is called an internode. Only a few internodes elongate. The number of internodes, which elongate ranges from 3-8. An internode whose length exceeds 5mm is usually considered as elongated. The internodes of a culm vary in length usually increasing from the lower to the upper ones. The lower internodes are compressed into a solid section."

        "source": "output[1]",
        "content": "The number of nodes varies from 13 to 16 with only the upper 4 or 5 separated by long inter-nodes. Under rapid increases in water level, some deep-water rice varieties the lower inter-node can also elongate in length by over 30 cm each. The plant height is an inherited character. The plant height of the modern high yielding varieties may vary from 90 to 110 cm. with the dwarfing gene as compared to traditional tall varieties where the plant height may vary from 120 to 150 or more. The plant height in deep-water varieties with inter-node elongation ability may reach 5 m. under certain situation.A branch of the plant bearing the root, culm leaves and with or without a panicle is called a tiller. Tillers develop from leaf axils at each un-elongated node of the main shoot or from tillers during vegetative growth in an alternate order. On the culm the coleoptile and the first leaf do not produce tillers. Tillering starts from the second leaf when the fifth leaf on the main culm emerges. The primary tillers originate from the lower most nodes and give to secondary tillers, which in turn give rise to tertiary tillers. Tillering ability is a varietal character. The tall traditional varieties are usually low tillering and spreading while the modern high yielding varieties (HYV) have high tillering ability and are compact. In high tillering varieties all the tillers are not productive. Numerous environmental factors also affect tillering ability such as spacing, light, nutrient supply and cultural practices.The leaves arise from the node and are borne at an angle in an alternate phyllotaxy. Varieties differ in leaf number. A typical rice leaf consists of leaf sheath, auricle, ligule, leaf lamina or blade. The leaf sheath is continuous with the leaf blade. It encloses the culm above the node in varying length, form and tightness. The swelling at the base the leaf sheath is called pulvinus. It is above the nodal septum. The expanded portion of the leaf is called the leaf lamina or leaf blade. It has parallel venation. The prominent ridge on the lower surface is called the mid-rib. At the junction of the leaf blade and leaf sheath on the inside there are two triangular and membranous structures called ligules. On either side, there is a pair of hairy sickle shaped auricles."

        "content": "The white band around the junction between the blade and sheath is called the collar. The first rudimentary leaf at the base of the main culm is bladeless and two keeled bract. It is called the prophyllum. The margins of the prophyllum clasp the young tiller. Prophyllum is also present between each secondary and it's tertiary tiller. The upper most leaf below the panicle is called the flag or boot leaf. The traditional tall varieties have long droopy leaves, whereas the semi-dwarf modern HYVs have short, small and erect leaves.The floral organs of rice plants are modified shoots. The terminal internode bears the determinate inflorescence; called the panicle that bears spikelets. Panicle: The panicle consists of the panicle base, axis, primary and secondary branches, pedicel, rudimentary glumes and spikelets. The panicle axis extends from the panicle base to the apex interspersed with 8-10 nodes at two to 4 cm apart. Panicle branching is racemose. Primary branches develop from the nodes. Secondary branches develop from the primary branches. Pedicels develop from the nodes of primary and secondary branches, which bear the spikelets. The spikelet of rice consists of three flowers, two of which are reduced, in development. The enlarged cup like apex of the pedicle is homologous with a pair of glumes and called rudimentary glumes. The spikelet consists of a minute axis called rachilla, a pair of sterile lemmas glumes, lemma, palea and the flower. The lemma, palea and the included flower are together known as the floret. The sterile lemmas, lemma and palea are also called bracts. Lemma is the five-nerved keel shaped bracts, which partly encloses the palea. The tip of the lemma and palea is known as apiculus. The filiform extension of the keel of the lemma is called awn. Palea is a three-nerved bract, which fits closely to the lemma.The flower consists of six stamens and a pistil. Each stamen is composed of two celled versatile anthers borne on slender filaments. The pistil consists of an ovary with one ovule, short style and bifurcate plumose (hairy) stigma. Two fleshy, transparent structures located at the base of the flower, adnate to palea are called lodicules. Lodicules represent the perianth (calyx and corolla).The rice fruit is a caryopsis with a single seed fused to the ripened ovary wall, pericarp. Lemma and palea enclose the caryopsis. The rice grain is the ripened ovary with lemma, palea, rachilla sterile lemmas."

        "content": "The rice grain is also known as rough rice. The Lemma, palea, sterile lemmas, rachilla and the awn whenever present constitute the hull or husk. Dehulled rice grain is called brown rice. The caryopsis is enclosed by the pericarp. Next to the pericarp there are two layers of cells representing the remains of the integuments, or seed coat. The bulk of the caryopsis is the starchy endosperm. An aleurone layer encloses the endosperm, which lies below the tegmen. The embryo is located on the ventral side of the caryopsis. The embryo consists of plumule, mesocotyl, radicle, epiblast and scutellum.The plumule (embryonic leaves) is enclosed by the coleoptile, whereas the radicle (embryonic root) is ensheathed by coleorhiza. The embryonic axis mesocotyl is bounded on the inner side by scutellum adhering to the endosperm and on the outer side by the aleurone layer. The vascular trace fused with the lateral part of the scutellum is called the epiblast.USES: Raw or parboiled milled rice is cooked and used as food. It forms the main course of the meals for millions of people in Asia and else where. Many processed foods such as popped or puffed rice products are produced from brown rice or parboiled rice for use as breakfast cereals and snack foods. Beer, wine and spirits can be produced from the grain. Rice is mainly grown for food but it is also used in cosmetics, laundering starch, and textiles. An oil is produced and used as cooking and salad oil, for soap manufacture and it is made into a plastic packaging material. Husks are used as fuel, as an addition to concrete, for making hardboard and as an abrasive.The harvesting of rice produces straw as a by-product. Rice straw has poor palatability, bulkiness, low digestibility, low protein, high lignin and high silica contents. It is the most common feed ingredient for cattle in many developing countries in Asia and Pacific region, particularly in Bangladesh, India, Myanamar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Urea-treated rice straw as cattle feed is popular in Bangladesh. Rice straw is for making and repairing thatched houses in Bangladesh, Nepal and India. It is used for construction of grain storage structures, ropes, packaging material and bags in India. It is also used as fuel in Vietnam."

        "content": "In China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan rice straw is used in the production of paper.The chief by-products produced during milling are husks, bran and \u0152brokens\u201a. Husks are used as domestic fuel in many countries. In Myanmar rice husks are used as fuel for the operation of rice mills, for parboiling in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar Nepal and Sri Lanka, in China for the production of steam or gas for power generation. Rice husks are also used as packaging and insulation material. Although rice husk exhibits a low protein and high fiber content, they are used as animal feed in Bangladesh, China and India. Rice husks on burning produce 20 % (by weight) of ash containing 90% silica. In India, rice husk ash is fillet in the rubber industry and in the steel industry as an insulating material.Rice bran is highly nutritious. It contents lipids, protein, minerals and vitamins. Because of its nutritional value, it is used as a feed for poultry and livestock. Refined bran oil is utilized as a salad oil as well as for cooking. Crude bran oil is used in the production of soap. In China oryzanol is extracted from crude bran oil, which has pharmaceutical use. De-oiled rice bran is used to for the commercial extraction of phytin.Rice brokens have a variety of uses such as animal feed, making rice flour and malt sugar for breweries. It is used in a variety of ways to prepare processed rice based food products.The seed has nutrient, remineralizing, antidiarrhoeic and emollient properties and administration is as decoction and powder.KILLING T.: Growth arrested below 10\u00b0C; rice exhibits little or no frost tolerance. GROWING PERIOD:  Annual grass, wetland types growing 80-150 days, while floating rice may require 180-200 days to mature. COMMON NAMES: Rice, riz, arroz, reis, ris, arishi, arroz, byeo, cau, chawal, dao, dhan. FURTHER INF. : Rice is grown in four ecosystems, which are broadly defined on the basis of water regimes. The ecosystems are irrigated, rain-fed lowland, upland and flood-prone, which cover 55, 25, 13 and 7% of the world's rice area respectively and account for 76, 17, 4 and 3% of the world's current rice production. The cultivation of indica is confined to areas between 0\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 latitude, it is seldom grown above 1200 m in elevation and performs best below 600m. They are hardy, resistant to diseases and tolerate unfavourable growing conditions."

Asian rice was domesticated in China some 13,500 to 8,200 years ago; African rice was domesticated in Africa about 3,000 years ago. Rice has become commonplace in many cultures worldwide; in 2021, 787 million tons were produced, placing it fourth after sugarcane, maize, and wheat. Only some 8% of rice is traded internationally. China, India, and Indonesia are the largest consumers of rice. A substantial amount of the rice produced in developing nations is lost after harvest through factors such as poor transport and storage. Rice yields can be reduced by pests including insects, rodents, and birds, as well as by weeds, and by diseases such as rice blast. Traditional rice polycultures such as rice-duck farming, and modern integrated pest management seek to control damage from pests in a sustainable way. Rice Varieties and Biotechnology\nMany varieties of rice have been bred to improve crop quality and productivity. Biotechnology has created Green Revolution rice able to produce high yields when supplied with nitrogen fertilizer and managed intensively. Other products are rice able to express human proteins for medicinal use; flood-tolerant or deepwater rice; and drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties. Rice is used as a model organism in biology. Rice Processing and Nutrition\nDry rice grain is milled to remove the outer layers; depending on how much is removed, products range from brown rice to rice with germ and white rice. Some is parboiled to make it easy to cook. Rice contains no gluten; it provides protein but not all the essential amino acids needed for good health. Rice of different types is eaten around the world. Long-grain rice tends to stay intact on cooking; medium-grain rice is stickier, and is used for sweet dishes, and in Italy for risotto; and sticky short-grain rice is used in Japanese sushi as it keeps its shape when cooked. White rice when cooked contains 29% carbohydrate and 2% protein, with some manganese. Golden rice is a variety produced by genetic engineering to contain vitamin A. Rice Production and Environmental Impact\nProduction of rice is estimated to have caused over 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2022."

        "content": "Predictions of how rice yields will be affected by climate change vary across geographies and socioeconomic contexts. In human culture, rice plays a role in various religions and traditions, such as in weddings. Rice Plant Description\nThe rice plant can grow to over 1 m (3 ft) tall; if in deep water, it can reach a length of 5 m (16 ft). A single plant may have several leafy stems or tillers. The upright stem is jointed with nodes along its length; a long slender leaf arises from each node. The self-fertile flowers are produced in a panicle, a branched inflorescence which arises from the last internode on the stem. There can be up to 350 spikelets in a panicle, each containing male and female flower parts (anthers and ovule). A fertilized ovule develops into the edible grain or caryopsis. Rice is a cereal belonging to the family Poaceae. As a tropical crop, it can be grown during the two distinct seasons (dry and wet) of the year provided that sufficient water is made available. It is normally an annual, but in the tropics it can survive as a perennial, producing a ratoon crop. Agronomy: Growing Rice\nLike all crops, rice depends for its growth on both biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The principal biotic factors are crop variety, pests, and plant diseases. Abiotic factors include the soil type, whether lowland or upland, amount of rain or irrigation water, temperature, day length, and intensity of sunlight. Rice grains can be planted directly into the field where they will grow, or seedlings can be grown in a seedbed and transplanted into the field. Direct seeding needs some 60 to 80 kg of grain per hectare, while transplanting needs less, around 40 kg per hectare, but requires far more labor. Most rice in Asia is transplanted by hand. Mechanical transplanting takes less time but requires a carefully-prepared field and seedlings raised on mats or in trays to fit the machine. Rice does not thrive if continuously submerged. Rice can be grown in different environments, depending upon water availability. The usual arrangement is for lowland fields to be surrounded by bunds and flooded to a depth of a few centimeters until around a week before harvest time; this requires a large amount of water. The \"alternate wetting and drying\" technique uses less water."

    {
        "source": "Wikipedia",
        "content": "One form of this is to flood the field to a depth of 5 cm (2 in), then to let the water level drop to 15 cm (6 in) below surface level, as measured by looking into a perforated field water tube sunk into the soil, and then repeating the cycle. Deepwater rice varieties tolerate flooding to a depth of over 50 centimeters for at least a month. Upland rice is grown without flooding, in hilly or mountainous regions; it is rainfed like wheat or maize. Harvesting Rice\nAcross Asia, unmilled rice or \"paddy\" (Indonesian and Malay padi), was traditionally the product of smallholder agriculture, with manual harvesting. Larger farms make use of machines such as combine harvesters to reduce the input of labor. The grain is ready to harvest when the moisture content is 20\u201325%. Harvesting involves reaping, stacking the cut stalks, threshing to separate the grain, and cleaning by winnowing or screening. The rice grain is dried as soon as possible to bring the moisture content down to a level that is safe from mold fungi. Traditional drying relies on the heat of the sun, with the grain spread out on mats or on pavements. Evolution and History of Rice\nThe edible rice species are members of the BOP clade within the grass family, the Poaceae. The rice subfamily, Oryzoideae, is sister to the bamboos, Bambusoideae, and the cereal subfamily Pooideae. The rice genus Oryza is one of eleven in the Oryzeae; it is sister to the Phyllorachideae. The edible rice species O. sativa and O. glaberrima are among some 300 species or subspecies in the genus. Domestication and Spread\nOryza sativa rice was first domesticated in China 9,000 years ago, by people of Neolithic cultures in the Upper and Lower Yangtze, associated with Hmong-Mien-speakers and pre-Austronesians, respectively. The functional allele for nonshattering, the critical indicator of domestication in grains, as well as five other single-nucleotide polymorphisms, is identical in both indica and japonica. This implies a single domestication event for O. sativa. Both indica and japonica forms of Asian rice sprang from a single domestication event in China from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon. Despite this evidence, it appears that indica rice arose when japonica arrived in India about 4,500 years ago and hybridized with another rice, whether an undomesticated proto-indica or wild O. nivara."

        "content": "Rice was introduced early into Sino-Tibetan cultures in northern China by around 6000 to 5600 years ago, and to the Korean peninsula and Japan by around 5500 to 3200 years ago. It was also carried into Taiwan by the Dapenkeng culture by 5500 to 4000 years ago, before spreading southwards via the Austronesian migrations to Island Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and Guam, but did not survive the voyage to the rest of the Pacific. It reached Austroasiatic and Kra-Dai-speakers in Mainland Southeast Asia and southern China by 5000 years ago. Rice spread around the rest of the world through cultivation, migration, and trade, eventually to the Americas as part of the Columbian exchange after 1492. The now less common Oryza glaberrima (African rice) was independently domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago, and introduced to the Americas by the Spanish. In British North America by the time of the start of the American War of Independence, rice had become the fourth most valuable export commodity behind only tobacco, wheat, and fish. Rice Production Statistics (2021)\nGlobal production: 787 million tonnes. Top producers:\n\nChina: 213 million tonnes. India: 195 million tonnes. Bangladesh: 57 million tonnes. Indonesia: 54 million tonnes. Vietnam: 44 million tonnes. Thailand: 30 million tonnes. World total: 787 million tonnes. In 2021, world production of rice was 787 million tonnes, led by China and India with a combined 52% of the total. This placed rice fourth in the list of crops by production, after sugarcane, maize, and wheat. Other major producers were Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam. 90% of world production is from Asia. Yield Records\nThe average world yield for rice was 4.7 metric tons per hectare (2.1 short tons per acre) in 2022. Yuan Longping of China's National Hybrid Rice Research and Development Center set a world record for rice yield in 1999 at 17.1 metric tons per hectare (7.6 short tons per acre) on a demonstration plot. This employed specially developed hybrid rice and the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), an innovation in rice farming. Food Security\nRice is a major food staple in Asia, Latin America, and some parts of Africa, feeding over half the world's population. However, a substantial part of the crop can be lost post-harvest through inefficient transportation, storage, and milling. A quarter of the crop in Nigeria is lost after harvest."

In China, losses in modern metal silos were just 0.2%, compared to 7\u201313% when rice was stored by rural households. Rice Processing\nFive-step animation showing the removal of successive layers from raw rice grains, starting with the grain with its inedible hull and ending with polished white rice. Rice processing removes one or more layers to create marketable products. Processing Steps:\nRice with chaff: The outermost layer. Brown rice: Only the husk is removed. Rice with germ: Bran is removed, but the germ remains. White rice: Bran and germ are removed. Polished rice: Fully processed, with no bran residue. The dry grain is milled to remove the outer layers, namely the husk and bran. These can be removed in a single step, in two steps, or as in commercial milling in a multi-step process of cleaning, dehusking, separation, polishing, grading, and weighing. Brown rice only has the inedible husk removed. Further milling removes bran and the germ to create successively whiter products. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming process before it is milled. This makes the grain harder and moves some of the grain's vitamins and minerals into the white part of the rice so these are retained after milling. Rice does not contain gluten, so is suitable for people on a gluten-free diet. Rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world, but it is not a complete protein as it does not contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts for good health. Rice Trade\nWorld trade figures are much smaller than those for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally. China, an exporter of rice in the early 2000s, had become the world's largest importer of rice by 2013. Developing countries are the main players in the world rice trade; by 2012, India was the largest exporter of rice, with Thailand and Vietnam the other largest exporters. Worldwide Consumption\nAs of 2016, the countries that consumed the most rice were China (29% of total), India, and Indonesia. By 2020, Bangladesh had taken third place from Indonesia. On an annual average from 2020 to 2023, China consumed 154 million tonnes of rice, India consumed 109 million tonnes, and Bangladesh and Indonesia consumed about 36 million tonnes each."

Carbohydrates: 28.6 g.\n\nFat: 0.2 g.\n\nProtein: 2.4 g.\n\nVitamins and minerals: Moderate levels of manganese (18% DV). Water: 69 g.\n\nRice is a commonly-eaten food around the world. The varieties of rice are typically classified as short-, medium-, and long-grained. Oryza sativa indica varieties are usually long-grained; Oryza sativa japonica varieties are usually short- or medium-grained. Short-grain rice, with the exception of Spanish Bomba, is usually sticky when cooked, and is suitable for puddings. Thai Jasmine rice is aromatic, and unusually for a long-grain rice has some stickiness, with a soft texture. Indian Basmati rice is very long-grained and aromatic. Italian Arborio rice, used for risotto, is of medium length, oval, and quite sticky. Japanese sushi rice is a sticky short-grain variety. Golden Rice\nGolden rice is a variety produced through genetic engineering to synthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the endosperm of the rice grain. It is intended to be grown and eaten in parts of the world where Vitamin A deficiency is prevalent. Golden rice has been opposed by activists, such as in the Philippines. In 2016, more than 100 Nobel laureates encouraged the use of genetically modified organisms, such as golden rice, for the benefits these could bring. Rice and Climate Change\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nIn 2022, greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation were estimated at 5.7 billion tonnes CO2eq, representing 1.2% of total emissions. Within the agriculture sector, rice produces almost half the greenhouse gas emissions from croplands, some 30% of agricultural methane emissions, and 11% of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Methane is released from rice fields subject to long-term flooding, as this inhibits the soil from absorbing atmospheric oxygen, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in the soil. Emissions can be limited by planting new varieties, not flooding continuously, and removing straw. It is possible to cut methane emissions in rice cultivation by improved water management, combining dry seeding and one drawdown, or executing a sequence of wetting and drying. This results in emission reductions of up to 90% compared to full flooding and even increased yields."

        "content": "Effects of Climate Change on Rice Production\nPredictions of climate change's effects on rice cultivation vary. Global rice yield has been projected to decrease by around 3.2% with each 1 \u00b0C increase in global average temperature, while another study predicts global rice cultivation will increase initially, plateauing at about 3 \u00b0C warming (2091\u20132100 relative to 1850\u20131900). The impacts of climate change on rice cultivation vary across geographic location and socioeconomic context. For example, rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century decreased rice yield by between 10% and 20% across 200 farms in seven Asian countries. This may have been caused by increased night-time respiration. IRRI has predicted that Asian rice yields will fall by some 20% per 1 \u00b0C rise in global mean temperature. Further, rice is unable to yield grain if the flowers experience a temperature of 35 \u00b0C or more for over one hour, so the crop would be lost under these conditions. In the Po Valley in Italy, the arborio and carnaroli risotto rice varieties have suffered poor harvests through drought in the 21st century. The Ente Nazionale Risi is developing drought-resistant varieties; its nuovo prometeo variety has deep roots that enable it to tolerate drought, but is not suitable for risotto. Pests, Weeds, and Diseases\nPests and Weeds\nRice yield can be reduced by weed growth, and a wide variety of pests including insects, nematodes, rodents such as rats, snails, and birds. Major rice insect pests include armyworms, rice bugs, black bugs, cutworms, field crickets, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mealybugs, and planthoppers. High rates of nitrogen fertilizer application may worsen aphid outbreaks. Weather conditions can contribute to pest outbreaks: rice gall midge outbreaks are worsened by high rainfall in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought. Diseases\nRice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe grisea, is the most serious disease of growing rice. It and bacterial leaf streak (caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) are perennially the two worst rice diseases worldwide; they are both among the ten most important diseases of all crop plants. Other major rice diseases include sheath blight (caused by Rhizoctonia solani), false smut (Ustilaginoidea virens), and bacterial panicle blight (Burkholderia glumae). Viral diseases include rice bunchy stunt, rice dwarf, rice tungro, and rice yellow mottle."

        "content": "Pest Management\nIntegrated Pest Management and Rice-Duck Farming\nCrop protection scientists are developing sustainable techniques for managing rice pests. Sustainable pest management is based on four principles: biodiversity, host plant resistance, landscape ecology, and hierarchies in a landscape\u2014from biological to social. Farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary. Pesticides may actually induce resurgence of populations of rice pests such as the brown planthopper, both by destroying beneficial insects and by enhancing the pest's reproduction. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) demonstrated in 1993 that an 87.5% reduction in pesticide use can lead to an overall drop in pest numbers. Traditional Practices: Rice-Duck Farming\nFarmers in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines have traditionally managed weeds and pests by the polycultural practice of raising ducks and sometimes fish in their rice paddies. These produce valuable additional crops, eat small pest animals, manure the rice, and in the case of ducks also control weeds. Plant Defenses and Synthetic Chemicals\nRice plants produce their own chemical defenses to protect themselves from pest attacks. Some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-D, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plant's resistance to some types of pests. Conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide imidacloprid, appear to induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that make the plant more susceptible to certain pests. Resistant Rice Cultivars\nPlant breeders have created rice cultivars incorporating resistance to various insect pests. Conventional plant breeding of resistant varieties has been limited by challenges such as rearing insect pests for testing, and the great diversity and continuous evolution of pests. Resistance genes are being sought from wild species of rice, and genetic engineering techniques are being applied. Ecotypes and Cultivars\nList of Rice Cultivars\nThe International Rice Research Institute maintains the International Rice Genebank, which holds over 100,000 rice varieties. Much of southeast Asia grows sticky or glutinous rice varieties. High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in Africa, called the New Rice for Africa (NERICA), have been developed to improve food security and alleviate poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. Genome Sequencing\nThe complete genome of rice was sequenced in 2005, making it the first crop plant to reach this status. Since then, the genomes of hundreds of types of rice, both wild and cultivated, and including both Asian and African rice species, have been sequenced."

        "content": "Biotechnology\nHigh-Yielding Varieties\nThe high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created during the Green Revolution to increase global food production radically. The first Green Revolution rice variety, IR8, was produced in 1966 at the International Rice Research Institute through a cross between an Indonesian variety named \"Peta\" and a Chinese variety named \"Dee Geo Woo Gen\". Green Revolution varieties were bred to have short strong stems so that the rice would not lodge or fall over. This enabled them to stay upright and productive even with heavy applications of fertiliser. Expression of Human Proteins\nVentria Bioscience has genetically modified rice to express lactoferrin and lysozyme, which are proteins usually found in breast milk, and human serum albumin. These proteins have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects. Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in oral rehydration solutions to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse anemia. Flood-Tolerance\nDeepwater Rice\nIn areas subject to flooding, farmers have long planted flood-tolerant varieties known as deepwater rice. In South and South East Asia, flooding affects some 20 million hectares (49 million acres) each year. Flooding has historically led to massive losses in yields, such as in the Philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $65 million were lost to flooding. Swarna Sub1 and Scuba Rice\nStandard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding for more than about a week, since it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and gas exchange. The Swarna Sub1 cultivar can tolerate week-long submergence, consuming carbohydrates efficiently and continuing to grow. So-called \"scuba rice\" with the Sub1A transgene is robustly tolerant of submergence for as long as two weeks, offering much improved flood survival for farmers' crops. IRRI has created Sub1A varieties and distributed them to Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Drought-Tolerance\nImpact of Drought on Rice Production\nDrought represents a significant environmental stress for rice production, with 19\u201323 million hectares (47\u201357 million acres) of rainfed rice production in South and South East Asia often at risk. Under drought conditions, without sufficient water to afford them the ability to obtain the required levels of nutrients from the soil, conventional commercial rice varieties can be severely affected\u2014as happened for example in India early in the 21st century."

        "content": "Drought-Tolerant Varieties\nThe International Rice Research Institute conducts research into developing drought-tolerant rice varieties, including the varieties Sahbhagi Dhan, Sahod Ulan, and Sookha dhan, currently being employed by farmers in India, the Philippines, and Nepal respectively. In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine upland rice variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety. Salt-Tolerance\nImpact of Soil Salinity\nSoil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season. For example, roughly 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils. These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants' physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these areas. Salt-Tolerant Varieties\nProgress has been made in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species Oryza coarctata is one example. O. coarctata can grow in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but does not produce edible rice. Developed by the International Rice Research Institute, the hybrid variety utilises specialised leaf glands that remove salt into the atmosphere. It was produced from one successful embryo out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then backcrossed to IR56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from O. coarctata. Cold Tolerance\nImpact of Cold on Rice Growth\nRice is sensitive to temperatures below 12\u00b0C. Sowing takes place once the daily average temperature is reliably above this limit. Average temperatures below that reduce growth; if sustained for over four days, germination and seedling growth are harmed and seedlings may die. In larger plants subjected to cold, rice blast is encouraged, seriously reducing yield."

Reducing Methane Emissions\nEnvironmental Impact of Rice Paddies\nProducing rice in paddies is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by methanogenic bacteria. These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, consuming nutrients released by rice roots. Genetic Modification to Reduce Methane\nPutting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot, decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%. Further, the modification increases the amount of rice grains. Model Organism\nRice as a Model Organism\nRice is used as a model organism for investigating the mechanisms of meiosis and DNA repair in higher plants. For example, study using rice has shown that the gene OsRAD51C is necessary for the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis."

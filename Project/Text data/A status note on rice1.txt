1. Background
India cultivates rice on 43.86 million hectares, producing 104.80 million tonnes with a productivity of 2390 kg/ha (Agricultural Statistics at a Glance, 2015).
Productivity is lower than other major rice-growing countries like China (6710 kg/ha), Vietnam (5573 kg/ha), Indonesia (5152 kg/ha), and Bangladesh (4375 kg/ha).
Challenges: Majority of cultivated land belongs to marginal, small, and medium farmers.
Opportunities: Improved technologies, hybrid rice cultivation, and various interventions can increase productivity.
2. Rice Growing Regions in India
Rice-growing areas in India are categorized into five major regions:

i. North-Eastern Region
Includes Assam and North-Eastern states.
Rice is grown in the Brahmaputra River basin under rainfed conditions due to heavy rainfall.
ii. Eastern Region
Includes Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.
High rice cultivation intensity in Ganga and Mahanadi river basins, mostly under rainfed conditions.
iii. Northern Region
Includes Haryana, Punjab, Western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.
Single crop of rice grown between May-July and September-December due to low winter temperatures.
iv. Western Region
Includes Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.
Rice is mainly grown under rainfed conditions from June-August to October-December.
v. Southern Region
Includes Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.
Rice is cultivated in deltaic tracts of Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery rivers under irrigated conditions.
3. Main Rice-Producing Countries
The top five rice-producing countries in terms of area, production, and productivity:

Country	Area (Million ha)	Production (Million tonnes)	Productivity (kg/ha)	Production Share (%)
China	30.58	205.21	6710	27.70
India	43.86	104.80	2390	21.81
Indonesia	13.84	71.29	5152	9.62
Bangladesh	11.78	51.50	4376	6.95
Vietnam	7.90	44.04	5573	5.94

4. Status of Rice in India
Rice feeds 60% of India's population.
Area under cultivation increased from 30.81 million ha in 1950-51 to 43.86 million ha in 2014-15 (142% increase).
Production increased from 20.58 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 104.86 million tonnes in 2014-15 (5x increase).
Yield improved from 668 kg/ha in 1950-51 to 2390 kg/ha in 2014-15.
Major producing states: West Bengal (15% of total production), Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu.
5. Agronomic Practices
i. Land Preparation
Ploughing followed by harrowing.
Puddling done with paddy puddler or rotavator.
Green manure crops (dhaincha/mung) may be incorporated.
ii. Seed Rate
Broadcasting: 80 kg/ha
Transplanting: 20-30 kg/ha
SRI (System of Rice Intensification): 5-8 kg/ha
iii. Seed Treatment
Carbendazim (Bavistin) 10g + Streptocycline 1g per 10 liters of water.
Seeds soaked for 24 hours before sowing/transplanting.
iv. Sowing Methods
Direct Seeding (Broadcasting): Seeds sown in unpuddled/puddled fields.
Transplanting:
Manual: 1/20th of transplanting area as nursery.
Mechanical: Mat/tray nursery.
SRI Method: 10-day-old seedlings planted at 25 cm x 25 cm spacing.
v. Sowing Time
Rice is grown in all three seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Summer) depending on regional climate.
vi. Fertilizer Management
Nitrogen: 80-100 kg/ha (split into 3 doses).
Phosphorus (Pâ‚‚Oâ‚…): 40-45 kg/ha.
Potassium (Kâ‚‚O): 30-40 kg/ha.
Bio-fertilizers (Azolla, Blue-Green Algae) can supplement nitrogen.
vii. Water Management
Proper leveling & drainage for efficient nitrogen uptake and weed control.
6. Plant Protection
i. Weed Management
Manual weeding (2-3 times) or herbicides like Anilophos, Butachlor, Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, Almix.
ii. Disease Management
Disease	Control Measures
Khiara	5kg zinc + 2.5kg lime per ha, 10 days after transplanting
Blast	Thiram (2.5g/kg seed) or Tricyclazole (1.5g/kg seed)
Brown Spot	Carbendazim (2g/kg seed) or Mancozeb (2.5g/kg seed)
Bacterial Leaf Blight	Streptocycline (1g) + Carbendazim (20g) per 10 liters of water
iii. Insect Management
Insect	Control Measures
Gundhi Bug	Spray Carbaryl 50WP (1500 g/ha)
Stem Borer	Spray Cartap 50WP (800 g/ha) or Chlorpyriphos 20EC (2000 ml/ha)
Brown Plant Hopper	Spray Imidacloprid 200SL (125 ml/ha)
iv. Harvesting & Threshing
Harvest when grains turn yellow (moisture < 25%).
Manual or mechanical threshing (combine harvester/thresher).
7. Export & Import of Rice
i. Basmati Rice
Export increased from 23.71 lakh tonnes in 2010-11 to 40.45 lakh tonnes in 2015-16.
Negligible imports (0.0046 lakh tonnes in 2010-11).
ii. Non-Basmati Rice
Fluctuating exports due to government policies.
Increased from 1.01 lakh tonnes in 2010-11 to 82.25 lakh tonnes in 2014-15.
